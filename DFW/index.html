                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a second year online Graduate Student at the University of Washington, studying Library and
                        Information Sciences. I
                        am originally from Minnesota though I have lived in New York City for the past two years. I
                        have
                        experience working in both academic and special libraries, having spent four years working at
                        the
                        Katherine A. Martin Library at the University of Minnesota-Duluth and one semester interning at
                        the
                        Whitney Museum of American Art.
                        <br>
                        <br>This website is dedicated to my Autumn 2018 Directed Field Work. I will be spending this
                        quarter working with the Reference Department at the Long Island University Brooklyn Library.
                        My three learning outcomes (as can be seen in the document below) are to shadow and assist at
                        the reference desk, observe and then lead instructional sessions, and to create necessary
                        LibGuides for the library’s website (which can be accessed on the LibGuides tab). Also found on
                        this site are my weekly reflections. I am very excited to get experience in reference through
                        this DFW, as it is a library area I have not had the opportunity to work in!

                <p>
                    <br>For some students, visiting a reference desk is viewed as intimidating. Perhaps this is because
                    they are worried about appearing stupid or because they are not quite sure of what exactly they
                    want or are looking for. For others, barriers such as limited time or a faraway location can turn
                    having to ask for help into a chore. Being able to instantly connect with a librarian via chat can
                    be helpful in both of these scenarios. Chat gives students more anonymity, allowing them to ask
                    their questions without fear of the librarian later recognizing and judging them. Chat also allows
                    for students to get quick answers from wherever they happen to be. The ability to chat with a
                    librarian opens students up to librarians on the student’s time and at the student’s discretion.
                    Personally, I just use chats to either express a problem to a company or to answer a small question
                    very quickly. What I found from my first shadowing of a chat encounter was much more of an
                    interaction than I had been expecting.
                    <br>
                    <br>The LibChat window is always open at the Reference Desk. When a new inquiry comes in, the
                    computer emits a ping sound and the top tab flashes to get the librarian’s attention. The first
                    chat that I witnessed came from a student, whom I have renamed Rose here, asking if she could print
                    in color at the library. The Reference Desk librarian immediately noticed when the new chat popped
                    up and replied that unfortunately there is not color printing anywhere on campus. This is
                    apparently a pretty common request, so I was shown by the librarian to direct students to a
                    printing store near campus. He offered Rose the information on the business, including their
                    website, price, and location. At first, we both believed that this would probably be the end of the
                    interaction. The chat is left open, as the librarian I shadowed explained that chats are not closed
                    on the library’s side until the student has closed it on their side.
                    <br>
                    <br>Here is where the interaction took the turn that I found compelling. Rose continued the
                    interaction, asking if the place was currently open and where it was, if it was far from the
                    school. The librarian stated that the print shop was about a five minute walk from campus. Rose
                    next explained that she was working on an assignment and only had a few pages. She asked if the
                    print shop had a page minimum for printing or if they did single pages. The librarian wrote back
                    that according to the website there was no minimum (the site had a per page price and no previous
                    students had mentioned a minimum. He also provided Rose with a phone number in case she had any
                    other questions.
                    <br>
                    <br>At this point we were again assuming that the conversation was most likely finished. There was
                    no response from Rose after this final bit of information and her chat box stayed open. My pure
                    speculation would be that she left the library page open while she went and did her printing. About
                    forty-five minutes later, the chat went inactive, with the chat box changing color from green to
                    red indicating that Rose had signed off.
                    <br>
                    <br>It would be expected for students to ask librarians questions about the library and its
                    services. What I found to be so interesting was that rather than cutting off the conversation after
                    getting the initial information, Rose continued to ask questions. Along with that, her questions
                    were ones that had theoretically been answered in the first response, when the librarian shared the
                    website with her. She trusted the librarian to have full knowledge of the establishment he was
                    pointing her to, which was a fair expectation that proved to be true. Through his own past
                    experience of the printing shop, as well as with utilizing the shop’s own website, the librarian
                    was able to answer all of Rose’s questions. The ease of use for the chat system almost turned the
                    librarian into a “Google” for Rose to ask her questions of.
                    <br>
                    <br>The ability of the librarian to answer all of Rose’s questions, as well as the fact that Rose
                    did not chat later with follow-up questions leads me to believe that this was a successful
                    reference interaction. The asker was able to get the necessary information to her question and I do
                    not have a way for this to have been improved upon in this specific case.
                    <br>

                <a class="text-center col-12" id="interaction2">
                    <h1>Interaction Two</h1>
                </a>
                <p>
                    <br> Librarians are the societal keepers of knowledge; we help people find what they need to know.
                    Unfortunately, sometimes people come to us expecting that our ability to find their answers means
                    that we will automatically do all of their work for them. Such seemed to be the case for my second
                    interaction reflection.
                    <br>
                    <br> At the Reference Desk, we were aware that a class had given an assignment for students to look
                    into specific topics, as we had already had a couple groups come in asking for assistance. Our last
                    group looking for help was four first year students. Their teacher had asked them to look into
                    bullying, requiring them to come up with five resources from the library to use in their research.
                    The group approached the desk and simply asked for the librarian to find them these resources.
                    Their body language (standing a bit away from the desk, fidgeting as if they wanted to leave,
                    talking amongst themselves) indicated they were hoping for a quick answer.
                    <br>
                    <br>The librarian used this as a learning exercise. She asked them how familiar they were with the
                    library’s site and resources. They all replied that they did not know much about how or where to
                    find materials. The librarian showed them the library’s website and how to search the catalog. She
                    quickly explained how keyword searches worked, offering different possible search terms they could
                    look into. The librarian showed them a few of the possible books to be checked out, noting the call
                    numbers and explaining that in the Library of Congress classification system, books of the same
                    subject are usually grouped together.
                    <br>
                    <br> In order to help them find the best books, the librarian then asked what their specific
                    research topic was. The students had not yet thought of a specific topic within bullying, and
                    debated for a few minutes. During this time, you could see them starting to get more comfortable
                    with spending time at the reference desk. One girl sat down at the chair by the desk, one took out
                    a notebook, and the other two physically moved closer to hear. Because there was a lot of material
                    on it, the group settled on cyber bullying. The librarian showed them the call numbers for books on
                    this, which they wrote down.
                    <br>
                    <br>With their list of required books completed, the librarian offered to help them find articles.
                    The girls explained that according to the assignment, they just needed any five sources. The
                    librarian challenged them to look at their topic a little deeper. Yes, they only needed to find
                    five sources, but since they were here with help, why not take full advantage? It is hard to
                    describe, but the way that she spoke with them was not pushy. She managed to offer her assistance
                    without making the students feel like they had no choice in the matter. She came off as genuine in
                    her desire to get the group the best resources for their assignment.
                    <br>
                    <br>One girl, who appeared to be the group leader, suggested that her group just stay and look for
                    articles with the librarian. Her reasoning echoed the librarian’s point, that her group might as
                    well get as many sources they could. The girls huddled around the librarian’s computer as she
                    walked them through the steps to searching the library’s databases. By the end of the interaction,
                    the group had multiple book call numbers, knew that there would be similarly subjected books next
                    to the books they were searching for, understood how to search databases, and had a list of
                    keywords to plug into databases that would yield relevant results.
                    <br>
                    <br>As said previously, some students come to a librarian hoping that by doing so they have avoided
                    the necessity of doing a lot of their own work. This has been noted as an issue with reference
                    desks in my classes. I chose to write about this interaction because it seemed to highlight this
                    problem, but ultimately resulted in the students engaging with the librarian. I was impressed at
                    how the librarian handled the group of students wanting to be handed a list of perfect sources,
                    teaching the group how the library website worked. Not only this, but the librarian was able to
                    take their broad subject matter and help them narrow it to a more manageable research topic. What
                    had started as a group of people haphazardly standing by a desk asking for answers morphed into a
                    group of students actively searching with a librarian to find the best materials for their topic.
                    <br>
                    <br>From this I learned that students are open to the learning experience. My past worry had been
                    that if a student expected, but was not given, quick and easy answers, he/she would become either
                    bored or annoyed. This still may be true, but from the interactions that I have witnessed at the
                    LIU Brooklyn Reference Desk, it appears that students do understand that by approaching a librarian
                    they are engaging in a two-way interaction.

                <p>
                    <br>After three and a half weeks of observation at the LIU Brooklyn Library’s Reference Desk, I had
                    become much more confident answering questions and guiding patrons through the library’s resources.
                    Furthermore, I became much more comfortable with the doing these tasks without direct supervision.
                    When an opportunity to sit alone at the Reference Desk during a staff meeting hour popped up, I was
                    more than happy to step in and help. This reflection is focused on an interaction I had assisting a
                    student while acting as the Reference Librarian at the Reference Desk.
                    <br>
                    <br>During my time alone, I was approached by a student who was looking for information about
                    Google Scholar. I offered to walk her through the website. The student sat on a stool across from
                    me and I turned my screen so we could both see. I navigated to scholar.google.com, saying that she
                    could also go to google and search “scholar”to find the site. She had a topic in mind, a very
                    technical nursing term, so we used her keywords to search. I scrolled through the results page,
                    highlighting how Google Scholar will label each item in brackets ( [Article], [Book], etc.).
                    <br>
                    <br>As we went through the Google Scholar site, I pointed out that on the right of the articles
                    were different ways to find the full text. Some had buttons linking to the article from other
                    websites and some had a “Find FullText @ LIU” button. I demonstrated clicking this button, which
                    allowed us access to the article through the LIU databases automatically because we were on campus.
                    I explained that she would have similar access to these resources at home, but in order for the LIU
                    button to appear, she needed to ensure that before she searched on Google Scholar she signed in to
                    her LIU account either through her email or the library website. Before I finished our interaction,
                    I made sure to ask if there was anything else she needed to search or any other assistance
                    required. She seemed very happy with the information provided and went back to her work station.
                    As I have mentioned before in other reflections, it is impossible for a librarian to be an expert
                    on every field. This proved to be the case here, as the student was studying a highly technical
                    nursing term that I was unfamiliar with. I enjoyed showing her Google Scholar, though, and I
                    genuinely felt like she was able to take away applicable knowledge. The one thing that I would
                    change would be to have taken time to familiarize myself more with the topic. By knowing more about
                    what I was searching for, perhaps I could have been a better judge of the quality of the resources.
                    As I have seen in most cases at the Reference Desk, the student asking for assistance was open to
                    direction and happy to take the time to learn from what I was saying. She took notes on what I was
                    doing and asked relevant questions (such as if it was possible to find these sources at her home).
                    <br>
                    <br>An unforeseen benefit to this interaction was that it lead into a Core Seminar class I observed
                    later. During this class, students are given time to search for sources on a topic and asked to
                    evaluate how trustworthy these sources are. Due to the large number of questions, I stepped in to
                    aid the teacher and instructor, answering students’ search questions. Another student asked me how
                    Google Scholar worked and I was able to quickly go through the same sort of presentation I had
                    showed to the student at the Reference Desk. In a later class, the Library Instructor also showed
                    the class how to operate Google Scholar. It became clear to me that while students may know of
                    Google Scholar’s existence, they may require some help on how to best use it.
