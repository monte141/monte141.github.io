            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I am a second year online Graduate Student at the University of
              Washington, studying Library and Information Sciences. I am
              originally from Minnesota though I have lived in New York City for
              the past two years. I have experience working in both academic and
              special libraries, having spent four years working at the
              Katherine A. Martin Library at the University of Minnesota-Duluth
              and one semester interning at the Whitney Museum of American Art.
              <br />
              <br />This website is dedicated to my Autumn 2018 Directed Field
              Work. I will be spending this quarter working with the Reference
              Department at the Long Island University Brooklyn Library. My
              three learning outcomes (as can be seen in the document below) are
              to shadow and assist at the reference desk, observe and then lead
              instructional sessions, and to create necessary LibGuides for the
              library’s website (which can be accessed on the LibGuides tab).
              Also found on this site are my weekly reflections. I am very
              excited to get experience in reference through this DFW, as it is
              a library area I have not had the opportunity to work in! <br />

            <em>Entrance to the Long Island University Brooklyn</em>
          </div>
          <p>
            <br />As a little introduction: though I have worked in an academic
            library during my undergrad for three years, I have not had a lot of
            contact with the reference department. At my school, the circulation
            desk was near the entrance to the building, with reference being
            their own desk on the next floor up. Because I was just a student, I
            was instructed not to answer reference questions, only to direct
            students to the trained professionals upstairs. I was very excited
            to hear about this opportunity at the Long Island University
            Brooklyn because it would allow me to gain experience in a new
            setting. My MLIS classes have touched on reference work, walking us
            through the reference interview process and ingraining the
            importance of open and neutral questions into my mind. I was and am
            particularly looking forward to being able to shadow real reference
            librarians and have their insight and mentorship as I start
            interacting with students. <br />
            <br />
            Only students, faculty, staff, and those with official visitor
            badges are allowed onto the LIU Brooklyn campus. This means that the
            people one sees in the library are usually the people who will have
            access to all of the resources because they have identification
            cards. The library begins on the third floor of the Library Learning
            Center Building. The main entrance on the third floor holds the
            Reference Desk, computers and printing stations, a Quiet Room, and a
            lot of study areas. There are two staircases that lead to the fourth
            floor, which holds more study spaces, staff offices, Interlibrary
            Loan, Periodicals, the Archives, and a Language Learning/Tutoring
            center. Oddly enough, to get to the fifth floor, one must either
            leave the library on the third floor and take the elevators down the
            hall, or on the fourth floor one may go through the Language
            Learning/Tutoring Center to the elevators there. The fifth floor
            holds the actual books, the Circulation Department, the Media
            Center, the Instructional Center, study spaces, and Administrative
            offices. <br />
            <br />I mention the layout of the building because my first
            impression was a mix of confusion and amazement. Even with all of my
            classes in library school, I still associate an academic library
            with physical items. However, it seems that in the LIU Brooklyn
            library, it was almost hard to find the physical items. There is a
            big emphasis on space for students. I spoke with one librarian who
            offered the idea that because their campus is nonresidential,
            perhaps they have more of a need for areas for students to get
            together to hang out and do homework between classes. There are no
            rules about noise level, plenty of seating for groups and
            individuals, and though food is discouraged, snacks still find their
            way into the building. This means that the University’s library is a
            popular and bustling place. There is a constant low rumble of
            conversations and students can be seen streaming in and out of the
            building near constant. <br />
            <br />The “Ask a Librarian” Reference Desk sits right at the
            entrance on the third floor. One of the first things I noticed while
            sitting and observing is that because it is a new semester with new
            students and classes, the open library setting invites a lot of
            directional questions. People recognize the library as an
            information center and rely on the librarian’s within to be able to
            tell them where they need to go. Unfortunately, I felt as lost as
            those students when they asked! I was very grateful to have someone
            who was familiar with the campus to step in and assist. Thankfully
            it is only week one, and I will have plenty of time to become more
            knowledgeable about the campus and resources. <br />
            <br />Another product of the Reference Desk being at the entrance is
            that it gets asked a lot of basic library questions. We had several
            students inquiring about the printing location and process, looking
            for different classrooms in the Instructional Center, and in need of
            office supplies. Even though times are listed on the door, there
            were also questions about the library’s hours. People seemed happy
            to come over to the Reference Desk for advice, even when they could
            see signage with answers to their questions. I think this says a lot
            about the approachability people felt towards the librarians here;
            the students really did seem to believe that the librarians were
            there to help them, no matter the question. I found that this meant
            that the librarians needed to not only be experts in their fields,
            but also experts in the campus. They needed to know where to point
            students looking to get ID cards, to turn in health forms, those
            having trouble finding classrooms, as well as showing students how
            to use the library website and being available for questions via
            phone, email, or chat. There were a lot of hats being worn by those
            manning the reference desk. <br />
            <br />This quarter I have three learning outcomes: shadowing and
            assisting at the reference desk, observing and leading a library
            instruction class, and creating a LibGuide for the website. My first
            week was mostly shadowing the reference desk, as well spending a bit
            of time getting acquainted with the concept of LibGuides and seeing
            what areas may be lacking on the LIU Brooklyn Library website. I
            liked slowly entering into the semester with the shadowing and
            learning, because they allowed for me to get my bearings on the
            environment. For my second week, I will be looking more at observing
            different teaching techniques! <br />

          <p>
            <br />By the beginning of my second week, I was starting to feel
            much more comfortable with the tasks I was observing. I had picked
            up the answers to the more common questions asked of the desk (I had
            an idea of basic locations, could explain printing, and was able to
            point out the stapler). I also noticed that I was actively
            recognizing students who spent a lot of time in the library. My
            confidence in my environment definitely translated to confidence at
            my job. My first week I did answer student questions at the desk,
            but I would also try to direct them to the professional librarian if
            possible and explain that I may be incorrect. This week, I was tried
            to be more authoritative and answer the questions I knew the answers
            to in a manner that did not require other assistance. Of course, had
            I gotten a complicated question or one that stumped me, I definitely
            would have turned for help. But, I enjoyed being able to sit and be
            of some use answering student questions. <br />
            <br />Another new experience for me this week was starting my
            teaching observation. I shadowed six one-hour classes taught by
            three different librarians. I am sure I will go into more exact
            detail in my personal teaching reflection, but I still want to
            mention a bit about the classes here in my reflection. <br />
            <br />LIU Brooklyn’s First Year Seminar (FYS) library training is an
            approximately fifty minute class on how to use the library.
            Originally, it was a librarian projecting a screen to students and
            displaying how to find databases and citations. About five years
            ago, this was changed to a more interactive learning technique.
            Today, students participate in a game called “The Amazing Library
            Race.” Like the TV show, students are put into small groups and
            given clues. They must complete each set of clues before moving on
            to the next ones. Whichever team completes all four legs of the race
            first is awarded a prize. <br />
            <br />I really enjoyed watching this all play out. During my study
            abroad course this past summer we had two librarians from Oregon
            come to speak to us about their library instruction. Similarly, they
            use games to reinforce library facts as they say interaction
            promotes better understanding. I think this is shown through “The
            Amazing Library Race.” Many of the students came in quite lost,
            unsure of how to get to the classroom. Within the class period,
            though, they learned the locations of several key area (circulation,
            media center, computer labs, etc) and what resources the library has
            to offer. <br />
            <br />My final reflection of this week comes from one of my previous
            worries. Going into this directed fieldwork, I had been a little
            nervous about being the “knowledge center” of the library. To me,
            reference librarians are magic. They can find you anything you need
            to know! That is a very tall order to fill. And indeed, I found the
            reference librarians I came into contact with were every bit as
            intelligent and skilled as I had anticipated. But what I also
            noticed is that to be a reference librarian, you don’t actually need
            to know everything. <br />
            <br />There are some things librarians are expected to know, but
            when students come with very specific questions, they did not seem
            angry or put out that the librarian had to do a bit of research with
            them to find the answers. One interaction I saw was a student asking
            about how to determine if her sources were reputable. She explained
            her subject and went through the sources with the librarian. The
            student was not surprised that the librarian first had to google the
            subject to get her bearings on what research would be appropriate
            for the topic. Instead, it allowed the librarian and the student to
            discuss the subject together and come up with ideas. <br />
            <br />I had felt this pressure that I needed to know everything
            right away to be the most helpful. However, after shadowing this
            week I was relieved to find that instead of needing to be an expert
            in every field, I just have to be open and ready to look into any
            topic. <br />

          <p>
            <br />Library Instruction was a task I was quite nervous to delve
            into. My previous library instruction experience has only been as a
            student, going through basic library functions in my Freshman
            Seminar and Composition classes during my undergrad. Added to this
            was the previously mentioned talk by library instructors I was
            present for during my study abroad course this past Early Fall. When
            Library Instruction was offered as a possible learning outcome by my
            DFW supervisor, I was unsure of what exactly this would entail, but
            more than willing to give it a go. <br />
            <br />For the past two weeks, most of my instructional observation
            has been on the First Year Seminar (FYS) Library Introduction, a
            relay race entitled “The Amazing Library Race.” I observed four
            different instructors leading multiple classes of new freshman
            through a race about the library and its materials. At the end of my
            second week, I was able to step in and co-lead a class with a
            librarian. I assisted in giving instructions and passing out clues
            as teams returned. This was the perfect introduction for me, as it
            allowed me to test my instructional knowledge with a back-up for
            anything I forgot. I was a bit nervous, so some of the details did
            slip my mind, and the librarian was there to make sure the students
            got all of the information. While I was running the race, it was
            also clear to the students that the librarian was my supervisor, and
            they would bring their answers to her before showing them to me.
            Overall, having the opportunity to co-lead allowed me to test my
            skills while also having a safety net when necessary. <br />
            <br />By this week, I was very comfortable in the structure of the
            FYS classes. I lead my first solo Amazing Library Race session on
            Wednesday, following it up with another session on Thursday. Both
            went well, and when reflecting on them I do not think there was any
            information I had forgotten to give to the students. Although it was
            nice to co-lead, teaching a class on my own was good because I was
            forced into a true leadership role. I was fully in charge, from set
            up to take down. Finally, teaching races helped me to feel like a
            part of the reference team. I was able to help out, picking up a
            class that needed a new instructor. It is always a good feeling when
            you know you are helping. <br />
            <br />I do not have a public speaking phobia, but many times having
            to speak in front of groups makes me nervous. I was surprised to
            find that with the library instruction, once I got into the groove,
            this anxiety just melted away. I had sit through enough classes to
            know what to say, how to give hints, and what to expect from the
            students. When looking back at my week, I noted that I was genuinely
            happy with the teaching experience. In fact, it is now something
            that I would think about pursuing in my future career. I don’t know
            if I would want to be a full-time library instructor, but my limited
            classroom time at LIU Brooklyn has showed me that it would be an
            element to a future job that I would enjoy. <br />
            <br />There are still other classes that I am going to observe. I
            have watched an English 16 (basic composition) class, which involved
            actual database searching and instruction, rather than a library
            overview. This in-depth look on how and what to search is more akin
            to my previous library instruction experience. I am hoping to get to
            sit in on other, more advanced classes as well. Perhaps if I learn
            enough from observation, I can begin to co-lead or even fully teach
            one of these other sessions! <br />

            <br />Technology and web skills are crucial for academic librarians.
            Librarians are known for being able to search different areas for
            information; what many may not realize is that often librarians
            contribute to the websites they may be searching. LibGuides are a
            popular content management system for libraries to create web pages.
            In layman’s terms, LibGuides are web templates that libraries can
            add their own information to. <br />
            <br />
            In order to gain as many of the necessary technology skills to work
            in an academic library, part of my learning outcomes in my Directed
            Fieldwork is creating LibGuides for the LIU Brooklyn Library’s
            website. To prepare, I spent the first couple weeks looking through
            the LibGuides currently on the site. I noted which subjects and
            courses had pages, clicking through and seeing the formats. I also
            compared these guides to those featured on by Springshare, the
            company that owns LibGuides, on their own website. <br />
            <br />My advisor and I each came up with possible LibGuides that I
            could create during the quarter. After some discussion, we settled
            on one academic LibGuides for a course and one lifestyle LibGuide
            for all students and faculty. For my fourth week I focused on
            beginning to write, style, and format my academic guide. Armed with
            the class syllabus and access to other class guides, I prepared to
            complete a page for OT [Occupational Therapy] 306: Therapy Skills.
            <br />
            <br />LibGuides pages are fairly easy to create. Thankfully, there
            are also a lot of instructional videos on Youtube to show how to do
            nearly any task! Along with this, LIU Brooklyn Library has a
            specific style format for all of their pages, so I did not have to
            worry about creating color schemes. I just had to decide what pages
            were necessary, what should be on those pages, and then create or
            find the information to include. <br />
            <br />I ended up working a lot on the content and formatting. I was
            surprised at how my limited coding skills made my pages look so much
            nicer. I decided to not only create my own boxes, but copied and
            reformatted boxes from other LIU Brooklyn Library pages, inserted
            videos, and added images. In the end, I felt very confident that my
            pages were informative, varied, and relevant. My advisor gave me
            feedback at the midway point and as I was nearing the end of my
            page. Because of this feedback, I am entering into my fifth week
            with slight alterations still to make to my pages to bring them up
            to professional standard. <br />
            <br />Before this DFW, LibGuides was something I knew existed, but
            was not something I had a lot of knowledge about. Considering the
            amount of time I was allowed to learn, play with, and change my
            page, I am very glad that I was able to begin my LibGuide experience
            in a learning environment. I know that this is a highly valuable
            skill for employed librarians and will probably be a task I complete
            in future work.

            <br />As midterms approach at LIU Brooklyn, more and more classes
            have been scheduling instructional classes at the library. This
            week, in addition to sitting at the Reference Desk and working on my
            LibGuides, I observed four classes: two were English 16 classes
            (basic composition) with different instructors, one was a Core
            Seminar class (another basic writing class, focused more on
            evaluating sources than the technicalities of writing), and one was
            for Law 211 (writing using law cases). I had previously sat in on an
            English 16 and a Core Seminar class, taught by different instructors
            than this week. <br />
            <br />Through all of my observation, I picked up that there are
            certain things that every instructor does, and certain little bits
            they do to make their classes unique. Every instructor began the
            class with a basic introduction to the library. No matter the majors
            or years, every class seemed like a mix of people who had been to
            the library before and those who had not. Instructors would explain
            the library’s web site and the differences between books, ebooks,
            and articles. Each instructor also would show how to search both the
            catalog and the database list. <br />
            <br />Before each class the instructors had looked through the
            syllabus and the assignments the students were working on. They
            usually had already done some preliminary searches, figuring out the
            best keywords and databases to use. This is not to say that they did
            not improvise or change things in class, just that they came
            prepared with searches they knew would be good examples. They would
            also have prepared an activity for the class to work on. Typically
            they tried to tie this to the class assignment. For example, in one
            of the English 16 classes the students were given a sheet to help
            evaluate articles they found. They were instructed to find at least
            one relevant article to their topic and email it to themselves and
            their teacher. Hopefully, having this source would help them as they
            started writing their paper. <br />
            <br />There are many small variances between teaching styles. Each
            instructor has created his/her own activities for the group, so
            these may differ slightly. When one instructor for English 16 found
            that none of the students had experience with call numbers, she took
            the whole class into the circulation area to demonstrate how to find
            a book in the stacks. Overall, though there may be differences, by
            the end of each class it seemed like students not only had a better
            grasp on the library and its resources, but also had a good idea of
            where to start their research. <br />
            <br />My goal is to start to take a more active role in these
            instructional classes. Now that the First Year Seminar classes are
            winding down, the classes will be more focused on actual research
            methods and techniques. With additional observation in the coming
            weeks, my Directed Fieldwork Supervisor and I hope that I can start
            to step in to co-teach some of the more common instructional
            classes.

            <br />This week marks being halfway through the quarter. That means
            my supervisor and I took time this week to sit and complete the
            Mid-Quarter Report and reflect on how things have gone so far.

            <br />
            <br />In just six weeks, I have accomplished a lot of my Learning
            Outcomes. First, I have observed interactions at the Reference Desk.
            This was very informative as I have not previously worked in
            reference. I have become comfortable and competent enough that I
            have been able to staff the desk alone a few times, answering
            student questions and assisting in research. Second, I have shadowed
            many different library instruction classes, from First Year Seminar
            to Journalism to Law classes. Here, I have been able to begin
            teaching a First Year Seminar on my own. This has been great, not
            only because it is a fun experience, but also because I have been
            able to step in and assist when needed. Third, and last, I have
            successfully created multiple LibGuides for the LIU Brooklyn Library
            page. Before this, I knew what LibGuides were, but I had not had any
            experience with working on them personally. There was a bit of a
            learning curve, but with time and feedback, I now have two
            professional-level guides for students. Looking at all of these
            accomplishments, I am proud of how much I have done in just half of
            my Directed Field Work time.

            <br />
            <br />It is midterm for the Long Island University Brooklyn
            students, too. I see this at the Reference Desk with the sheer
            number of students in and out of the library building. As the
            semester progresses, more and more students are spending time
            working and studying in the library. During the first few weeks
            there were indeed students in the library, but many of them could be
            found sitting in groups and socializing. Now, one still has groups
            who are just hanging out, but more often than that, one will see
            students sitting alone or in small groups, heads bent over notebooks
            and computers. There is a steady stream of students entering and
            leaving, even earlier in the morning.

            <br />
            <br />With the increase in students, there has been an increase in
            research questions. At the beginning of the quarter, I saw a lot of
            students coming to the Ask-A-Librarian desk for directions and more
            basic questions (such as, how/where do I print?). Increasingly,
            students coming up to the desk will have an assignment in hand and
            ask more detailed questions. This has been very helpful, as I can
            watch the librarian-on-duty’s search techniques and review research
            tips.

            <br />
            <br />As new students are getting more comfortable in the campus,
            First Year Seminar classes are winding down. Instead, I am seeing
            more advanced classes coming in for library sessions. These classes
            are focused on preparing for their final assignments. Though there
            is a library resources overview, a lot of these classes are centered
            around how to find the best results for their particular field. For
            example, in a Law class I observed, the instructor showed some of
            the Law databases, as well as how to best craft keywords to get
            relevant results.

            <br />
            <br />Of course, a reflection of the past half of the quarter would
            not be complete without a note of what I hope for the next half. In
            the coming five weeks, there is still a lot I am hoping to do. Per
            my Learning Outcomes, I will complete my interaction reflections and
            teaching reflection. As I continue to sit at the Reference Desk, I
            hope to interact with more students. I am also hoping that with
            final assignments coming up, I will be able to provide more
            research-specific assistance. I am currently waiting on final
            approval before my LibGuides will be published to the LIU Brooklyn
            Library site. Next, I will be turning my attention to updating and
            reformatting some of the popular handouts for the classes. Finally,
            with less First Year Seminar classes to teach, I am planning on
            starting to co-teach some of the English 16 classes. These are basic
            composition classes, with the instructor showing students the
            library resources and basic search techniques. Depending on how many
            classes I shadow, I may or may not begin co-teaching other classes
            as well.

            <br />
            <br />Thus far, I have learned an incredible amount from this DFW. I
            would highly recommend the experience and this location to others
            wanting to learn more about academic library work.

            <br />Midterms are finished and students are starting to work on
            final projects at LIU Brooklyn. This can be seen in the growing
            number of students working inside of the library. With larger
            projects and longer research papers coming up, the
            end-of-the-semester shift can also be seen in the library
            instructional courses being offered.

            <br />
            <br />Assuming that most freshmen are now familiar with the library,
            First Year Seminar classes have ended for the semester. I have
            started to observe more of the other instructional classes: English
            16 (basic composition), Core Seminar (research-based composition),
            Journalism, etc. After sitting in on quite a few of these sessions,
            I was invited to co-teach and English 16 class with my DFW
            supervisor.

            <br />
            <br />To prepare, we set out one hour before the class to go over
            the schedule. We looked through the syllabus the professor sent,
            becoming familiar with the assignment. We tested out some search
            terms in several databases, so that we knew which keywords would
            reveal the best results. We also pulled up the English 16 assignment
            sheet to be printed, copied, and distributed. About ten minutes
            before the session, we went up to open the classroom and set up. We
            met the teacher and explained that I was going to be assisting in
            the instruction for the day.

            <br />
            <br />For my first co-teaching experience, I walked the students
            through how to find and use the library website. I also demonstrated
            the Proquest and Opposing ViewPoints databases. At the end of the
            instruction, I assisted students in one-on-one as they searched.

            <br />
            <br />Following the class, my supervisor and I did a quick
            debriefing. We discussed what went well and what could be improved.
            I had been very nervous, so one of the suggestions was to go through
            the steps to get to the databases slower next time. In the moment,
            it can be easy to get flustered and assume that everyone already
            knows what you are doing. But, the key to getting students to
            remember these instructions and databases is to slowly walk them
            through each step.

            <br />
            <br />I tried to remember and utilize this advice in my second
            co-teaching experience later this week. In this English 16 class I
            started by showing a video pulled from another librarian about how
            to evaluate sources. I then demonstrated how to search Proquest,
            JSTOR, and Google Scholar. I had not had as much preparation for
            this class, but I found that it was similar enough to the previous
            one that I had few problems. The students here offered great search
            topics, which allowed for me to show many of the database features.
            At the end I walked around offering assistance to students.

            <br />
            <br />It always surprises me how much I enjoy leading instructional
            sessions. Before this DFW, I think seeing instruction as a main duty
            in a job description would have made me feel dread. Now, I have
            confidence that not only would I be able to lead instruction, but
            that I would have a good time doing so. I cannot possibly describe
            how much being able to observe so many classes led by different
            librarians helped me. I am not sure if I would want to be a
            full-time instructional librarian, but I can say after this
            experience that I could see it as part of my duties in the future.

            <br />
            This week was the final week of classes, which was surprisingly sad.
            I found that I really enjoyed not only observing other librarians,
            but also leading the instructional sessions. But, as I mentioned in
            other posts, this winding down of classes has correlated with an
            increase in research questions at the Reference Desk. <br />
            <br />
            Following the LibGuides, my next off-campus task has been creating a
            handout for Health Sciences students. The librarians currently have
            an old physical handout, but lack of a corresponding computer file
            means that this handout cannot be updated. To remedy this, I am
            creating a completely new handout, using the basic ideas from the
            old one. To do this, my supervisor and I went through the old
            handout, making notes on what to update and what to change. I also
            read through the class syllabus and went over the Health Sciences
            library instruction class layout in order to familiarize myself with
            what students would need. <br />
            <br />
            The Health Sciences handout is one page, back and front. The front
            page has library information, such as how to get in touch with a
            librarian and how to find and access materials. The back page is
            subject-specific. It details how to find Health Science databases,
            lists commonly used Health Science databases, and has some relevant
            health websites listed. Along with this there are some basic
            searching tips. As of the end of week eight, my handout has been
            forwarded to my supervisor and is awaiting feedback for possible
            improvements. <br />
            <br />
            Going into this task, I was a bit worried about my lack of graphic
            design skills. I was not sure that I would be able to format my
            handout to be interesting and informative. I had so much to say that
            this did not turn out to be an issue at all! As with learning the
            LibGuides site, it just took some time to think through what I was
            hoping to accomplish and taking the time to learn the system well
            enough to get my desired results. I will report back in later weeks
            on the progress of this project. <br />
            <br />
            My biggest accomplishment this week was the publishing of my
            LibGuide pages. As of Monday afternoon, any student will be able to
            access my Occupational Therapy and Stress Management pages. I owe a
            lot of this success to my DFW supervisor, who spent a lot of time
            providing feedback and offering suggestions bring my work to a
            professional standard. Links to and screenshots of these guides can
            be found by clicking on the “LibGuides” link above.

          <p>
            <br />For some students, visiting a reference desk is viewed as
            intimidating. Perhaps this is because they are worried about
            appearing stupid or because they are not quite sure of what exactly
            they want or are looking for. For others, barriers such as limited
            time or a faraway location can turn having to ask for help into a
            chore. Being able to instantly connect with a librarian via chat can
            be helpful in both of these scenarios. Chat gives students more
            anonymity, allowing them to ask their questions without fear of the
            librarian later recognizing and judging them. Chat also allows for
            students to get quick answers from wherever they happen to be. The
            ability to chat with a librarian opens students up to librarians on
            the student’s time and at the student’s discretion. Personally, I
            just use chats to either express a problem to a company or to answer
            a small question very quickly. What I found from my first shadowing
            of a chat encounter was much more of an interaction than I had been
            expecting. <br />
            <br />The LibChat window is always open at the Reference Desk. When
            a new inquiry comes in, the computer emits a ping sound and the top
            tab flashes to get the librarian’s attention. The first chat that I
            witnessed came from a student, whom I have renamed Rose here, asking
            if she could print in color at the library. The Reference Desk
            librarian immediately noticed when the new chat popped up and
            replied that unfortunately there is not color printing anywhere on
            campus. This is apparently a pretty common request, so I was shown
            by the librarian to direct students to a printing store near campus.
            He offered Rose the information on the business, including their
            website, price, and location. At first, we both believed that this
            would probably be the end of the interaction. The chat is left open,
            as the librarian I shadowed explained that chats are not closed on
            the library’s side until the student has closed it on their side.
            <br />
            <br />Here is where the interaction took the turn that I found
            compelling. Rose continued the interaction, asking if the place was
            currently open and where it was, if it was far from the school. The
            librarian stated that the print shop was about a five minute walk
            from campus. Rose next explained that she was working on an
            assignment and only had a few pages. She asked if the print shop had
            a page minimum for printing or if they did single pages. The
            librarian wrote back that according to the website there was no
            minimum (the site had a per page price and no previous students had
            mentioned a minimum. He also provided Rose with a phone number in
            case she had any other questions. <br />
            <br />At this point we were again assuming that the conversation was
            most likely finished. There was no response from Rose after this
            final bit of information and her chat box stayed open. My pure
            speculation would be that she left the library page open while she
            went and did her printing. About forty-five minutes later, the chat
            went inactive, with the chat box changing color from green to red
            indicating that Rose had signed off. <br />
            <br />It would be expected for students to ask librarians questions
            about the library and its services. What I found to be so
            interesting was that rather than cutting off the conversation after
            getting the initial information, Rose continued to ask questions.
            Along with that, her questions were ones that had theoretically been
            answered in the first response, when the librarian shared the
            website with her. She trusted the librarian to have full knowledge
            of the establishment he was pointing her to, which was a fair
            expectation that proved to be true. Through his own past experience
            of the printing shop, as well as with utilizing the shop’s own
            website, the librarian was able to answer all of Rose’s questions.
            The ease of use for the chat system almost turned the librarian into
            a “Google” for Rose to ask her questions of. <br />
            <br />The ability of the librarian to answer all of Rose’s
            questions, as well as the fact that Rose did not chat later with
            follow-up questions leads me to believe that this was a successful
            reference interaction. The asker was able to get the necessary
            information to her question and I do not have a way for this to have
            been improved upon in this specific case. <br />

            <h1>Interaction Two</h1>

            <br />
            Librarians are the societal keepers of knowledge; we help people
            find what they need to know. Unfortunately, sometimes people come to
            us expecting that our ability to find their answers means that we
            will automatically do all of their work for them. Such seemed to be
            the case for my second interaction reflection. <br />
            <br />
            At the Reference Desk, we were aware that a class had given an
            assignment for students to look into specific topics, as we had
            already had a couple groups come in asking for assistance. Our last
            group looking for help was four first year students. Their teacher
            had asked them to look into bullying, requiring them to come up with
            five resources from the library to use in their research. The group
            approached the desk and simply asked for the librarian to find them
            these resources. Their body language (standing a bit away from the
            desk, fidgeting as if they wanted to leave, talking amongst
            themselves) indicated they were hoping for a quick answer. <br />
            <br />The librarian used this as a learning exercise. She asked them
            how familiar they were with the library’s site and resources. They
            all replied that they did not know much about how or where to find
            materials. The librarian showed them the library’s website and how
            to search the catalog. She quickly explained how keyword searches
            worked, offering different possible search terms they could look
            into. The librarian showed them a few of the possible books to be
            checked out, noting the call numbers and explaining that in the
            Library of Congress classification system, books of the same subject
            are usually grouped together. <br />
            <br />
            In order to help them find the best books, the librarian then asked
            what their specific research topic was. The students had not yet
            thought of a specific topic within bullying, and debated for a few
            minutes. During this time, you could see them starting to get more
            comfortable with spending time at the reference desk. One girl sat
            down at the chair by the desk, one took out a notebook, and the
            other two physically moved closer to hear. Because there was a lot
            of material on it, the group settled on cyber bullying. The
            librarian showed them the call numbers for books on this, which they
            wrote down. <br />
            <br />With their list of required books completed, the librarian
            offered to help them find articles. The girls explained that
            according to the assignment, they just needed any five sources. The
            librarian challenged them to look at their topic a little deeper.
            Yes, they only needed to find five sources, but since they were here
            with help, why not take full advantage? It is hard to describe, but
            the way that she spoke with them was not pushy. She managed to offer
            her assistance without making the students feel like they had no
            choice in the matter. She came off as genuine in her desire to get
            the group the best resources for their assignment. <br />
            <br />One girl, who appeared to be the group leader, suggested that
            her group just stay and look for articles with the librarian. Her
            reasoning echoed the librarian’s point, that her group might as well
            get as many sources they could. The girls huddled around the
            librarian’s computer as she walked them through the steps to
            searching the library’s databases. By the end of the interaction,
            the group had multiple book call numbers, knew that there would be
            similarly subjected books next to the books they were searching for,
            understood how to search databases, and had a list of keywords to
            plug into databases that would yield relevant results. <br />
            <br />As said previously, some students come to a librarian hoping
            that by doing so they have avoided the necessity of doing a lot of
            their own work. This has been noted as an issue with reference desks
            in my classes. I chose to write about this interaction because it
            seemed to highlight this problem, but ultimately resulted in the
            students engaging with the librarian. I was impressed at how the
            librarian handled the group of students wanting to be handed a list
            of perfect sources, teaching the group how the library website
            worked. Not only this, but the librarian was able to take their
            broad subject matter and help them narrow it to a more manageable
            research topic. What had started as a group of people haphazardly
            standing by a desk asking for answers morphed into a group of
            students actively searching with a librarian to find the best
            materials for their topic. <br />
            <br />From this I learned that students are open to the learning
            experience. My past worry had been that if a student expected, but
            was not given, quick and easy answers, he/she would become either
            bored or annoyed. This still may be true, but from the interactions
            that I have witnessed at the LIU Brooklyn Reference Desk, it appears
            that students do understand that by approaching a librarian they are
            engaging in a two-way interaction.
          </p>
          <a class="text-center col-12" id="interaction3">
            <h1>Interaction Three</h1>
          </a>
          <p>
            <br />After three and a half weeks of observation at the LIU
            Brooklyn Library’s Reference Desk, I had become much more confident
            answering questions and guiding patrons through the library’s
            resources. Furthermore, I became much more comfortable with the
            doing these tasks without direct supervision. When an opportunity to
            sit alone at the Reference Desk during a staff meeting hour popped
            up, I was more than happy to step in and help. This reflection is
            focused on an interaction I had assisting a student while acting as
            the Reference Librarian at the Reference Desk. <br />
            <br />During my time alone, I was approached by a student who was
            looking for information about Google Scholar. I offered to walk her
            through the website. The student sat on a stool across from me and I
            turned my screen so we could both see. I navigated to
            scholar.google.com, saying that she could also go to google and
            search “scholar”to find the site. She had a topic in mind, a very
            technical nursing term, so we used her keywords to search. I
            scrolled through the results page, highlighting how Google Scholar
            will label each item in brackets ( [Article], [Book], etc.). <br />
            <br />As we went through the Google Scholar site, I pointed out that
            on the right of the articles were different ways to find the full
            text. Some had buttons linking to the article from other websites
            and some had a “Find FullText @ LIU” button. I demonstrated clicking
            this button, which allowed us access to the article through the LIU
            databases automatically because we were on campus. I explained that
            she would have similar access to these resources at home, but in
            order for the LIU button to appear, she needed to ensure that before
            she searched on Google Scholar she signed in to her LIU account
            either through her email or the library website. Before I finished
            our interaction, I made sure to ask if there was anything else she
            needed to search or any other assistance required. She seemed very
            happy with the information provided and went back to her work
            station. As I have mentioned before in other reflections, it is
            impossible for a librarian to be an expert on every field. This
            proved to be the case here, as the student was studying a highly
            technical nursing term that I was unfamiliar with. I enjoyed showing
            her Google Scholar, though, and I genuinely felt like she was able
            to take away applicable knowledge. The one thing that I would change
            would be to have taken time to familiarize myself more with the
            topic. By knowing more about what I was searching for, perhaps I
            could have been a better judge of the quality of the resources. As I
            have seen in most cases at the Reference Desk, the student asking
            for assistance was open to direction and happy to take the time to
            learn from what I was saying. She took notes on what I was doing and
            asked relevant questions (such as if it was possible to find these
            sources at her home). <br />
            <br />An unforeseen benefit to this interaction was that it lead
            into a Core Seminar class I observed later. During this class,
            students are given time to search for sources on a topic and asked
            to evaluate how trustworthy these sources are. Due to the large
            number of questions, I stepped in to aid the teacher and instructor,
            answering students’ search questions. Another student asked me how
            Google Scholar worked and I was able to quickly go through the same
            sort of presentation I had showed to the student at the Reference
            Desk. In a later class, the Library Instructor also showed the class
            how to operate Google Scholar. It became clear to me that while
            students may know of Google Scholar’s existence, they may require
            some help on how to best use it.

            <h1>Interaction Four</h1>
          </a>
          <p>
            <br />It is week seven and so far I have seen only a handful of
            phone calls and one chat while I have been at the Reference Desk. A
            large majority of the interactions I have observed or have been a
            part of have been with students approaching the Reference Desk in
            person. I was very eager when another chat popped up this week.

            <br />
            <br />My previous chat experience has been documented in my
            Interaction Reflection One. In this, a student was trying to get
            information about color printing. The chat this week was created by
            a student who was having issues getting access to an article. At
            first, the student worded her issue as “having problems opening a
            database.” The librarian on duty asked the student to clarify,
            eventually understanding that she was trying to open an article she
            found through a database, but was being denied access. This problem
            occasionally also presented at the Reference Desk. The librarian
            walked the student through the usual troubleshooting: ensuring that
            she was using her correct LIU username and password. To help, the
            student again tried to log in, then sent a screenshot of the page
            denying her access.

            <br />
            <br />The librarian noticed that in the photograph, the student had
            not indicated her status at LIU. Each LIU log-in has two options
            below the username and password fields: student at LIU and staff at
            LIU. The librarian instructed the student to try checking the
            correct box. The student replied that she had tried both options,
            but neither would work. In order to determine if the issue was with
            the article the student was trying to open, the librarian asked for
            the article information. The student sent another screenshot of the
            main article page, where one could see the article information and
            would normally have had the option to open the document in Full
            Text.

            <br />
            <br />Armed with all of the article’s information, the librarian
            wrote to the student that she was going to search for the article to
            see if this was a database issue rather than an account one. The
            article immediately opened, and was able to be downloaded and
            emailed. The librarian returned to the chat and explained to the
            student that the issue must be with her LIU account. The librarian
            apologized for the issue the student was facing and reassured her
            that she had been searching correctly. The librarian advised the
            student to check her account for holds (students with overdue
            tuition will not have access to library services) and contact the
            circulation department to have them check her library account. The
            librarian instructed the student to mention to the circulation
            worker that she had spoken with a reference library who had
            confirmed that she was searching correctly. The student thanked the
            librarian for her time, after which the librarian similarly thanked
            her for her question. The conversation ended with the librarian
            inviting the student to come back if she had any more questions.
            After a minute, the chat was closed on the student’s side.

            <br />
            <br />A lot of the research questions I have seen at the Reference
            Desk have come from students who do not know where to start. Many
            will have their assignment or their topic on them, but will ask for
            assistance in where and how to search. Similarly, I have seen a few
            students come with the sources they have found on their own, hoping
            a librarian will be able to help them to verify and evaluate the
            quality of their results. I chose to write about this interaction
            because it varied so much from the “usual” research questions I saw.

            <br />
            <br />In this case, the student knew exactly what she was looking
            for. It appeared that she had utilized her own search techniques and
            had successfully found relevant sources. Though her wording at the
            beginning of the chat was a bit confusing, it became clear that she
            had a good understanding of what databases, journals, and articles
            are. The screenshots sent were extremely helpful, as they allowed
            the librarian to see what the student was looking at and gauge what
            the possible issues might be. In this case, the student’s good grasp
            on the library resources allowed for a productive interaction.

            <br />
            <br />I do not think that there would be anything different I would
            recommend the librarian do in a future situation like this.
            Throughout the conversation she asked the best questions to
            determine the issue the student was having. She communicated well,
            indicating what she was doing and keeping the student in the loop.
            My biggest takeaway from this one, too, was the reassurance the
            librarian offered. Understanding that the situation is frustrating
            to the student, the librarian offered apologies for the issue. The
            librarian also mentioned several times via chat that the student was
            doing everything right and that this was an account error. I think
            this was a great touch. The student was probably not too happy about
            having to be transferred to another department, but at least the
            student could be confident that this was not something she was doing
            wrong. I believe that the student taking the time to say thank you
            at the end of the conversation shows that she felt valued and heard
            by the librarian.

          </a>
          <p>
            <br />
            I wanted to be sure to reflect on a complicated and involved
            research question for my final interaction, and as the end of the
            semester approaches, there have been many examples of these. For
            this reflection, I am looking at an interaction between a student
            completing her capstone, two librarians, and myself. <br />
            <br />The student, whom I later found out utilizes the Reference
            Desk frequently, approached and stated she “needed lifesaving help”
            on her capstone research. She pulled out an organized folder filled
            with papers and charts clipped together; one such stack she showed
            to the librarian. The student explained that she was working on her
            capstone presentation, focusing on suicide statistics in the United
            States in 2016. She had found a lot of interesting material so far,
            but her advisor had asked her to find a graph or chart breaking down
            the number of suicides per state, broken down by gender, age, and
            race of each person. <br />
            <br />The librarian turned her computer so the student would be able
            to follow along, and began her search. She first tried the Center
            for Disease Control’s website, as they keep statistical information
            on causes of death. Not finding exactly what the student required,
            the librarian moved to American FactFinder on the U.S. Census
            website, several suicide prevention websites, and Google. Each site
            held a lot of information, but none seemed to have each section
            required by the student. We would easily find statistics on one
            section, but this would not include a breakdown of the other
            categories. For example, there are many graphs showing the
            prevalence of suicide in each state, but these do not have
            demographic information on the people listed; similarly, there are
            charts showing the ages and race of those who have committed
            suicide, but these charts never merged together. After twenty
            minutes of searching, the first librarian’s shift came to an end.
            The librarian explained to the student that a colleague was going to
            be at the Reference Desk now and would be assisting her. The first
            librarian explained the second librarian what steps had been taken
            in the search before the second librarian took over. <br />
            <br />In order to quickly familiarize herself with the subject
            matter, the second librarian did a quick Google search and visited
            the websites previously looked at. The second librarian expanded the
            search, looking within the Proquest database to see if any articles
            or statistics appeared. Many article resulted, but none that fit the
            specifications for the student’s research. As the second librarian
            continued to search, it became apparent that this information was
            not going to be found. We backtracked to websites we had already
            looked at, tried as many different searches as we could, and
            brainstormed ways to find our data. <br />
            <br />Finally, the librarian had to apologize and suggested the
            student talk to her advisor. With three librarians searching for
            forty-five minutes, nothing could be found that met all of the
            advisor’s requirements. Together, the second librarian and I offered
            a few explanations and recommendations for the student. First, we
            suggested that this information was so specific that it might not
            actually exist. Also, we pointed out that research can take a while
            to get published, so it could be that all of the data the student
            was searching for was not compiled and analyzed yet. We had found
            all of the data the student had been looking for when searching, but
            these had been for years prior to 2015. It could be that 2016 data
            was not available yet. <br />
            <br />
            If the advisor wanted the student to have every piece of data we had
            searched for, we recommended that the student do one of three
            things: first, she could find individual graphs for each state with
            the suicide demographic information. This would results in an
            extremely long and possibly confusing reference list, but this way
            she would have all of the data. Second, we offered that she could
            look at the statistical rates for the entire United States, but
            place focus on just a few states. This would focus her research a
            little more and allow for the student to find state-specific graphs
            or charts without bogging down her research with 50 separate
            references. The third option would be to have the student submit
            multiple graphs to compile together for the full picture. For
            example, instead of one graph or chart showing U.S. suicide rates
            then broken down into state, age, gender, and race, the student
            could provide one graph on the U.S. suicide rates broken down by
            state, one graph of suicide rates broken down by age, etc. Having
            been a part of the search process, the student understood that what
            she was looking for may not be findable. She thanked the librarian
            and said she would contact her advisor to see how best to proceed.
            The librarian apologized again and invited her to come back after to
            do more searching. <br />
            <br />This was a great example of a longer reference search. The
            student was clearly prepared when she came in and had evidence of
            her own searching. Though we were not successful in finding exactly
            what the student’s advisor was looking for, we still managed to come
            away with many usable sources and ideas for changing the research. I
            really appreciated being involved in this interaction. I was able to
            brainstorm and offer up my own ideas, as well as watch experts in
            the research field using their own skills. I could not think of any
            ways to change this interaction; I feel like both librarians worked
            with the student to create the best searches possible.
            Unfortunately, not every request can be filled. It was also nice to
            see was that the student did not walk away empty-handed. Not only
            was she shown many new areas to explore on her own later, but we as
            a team had come up with possible solutions to slightly change her
            capstone in order to better find research and sources.
