                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a second year online Graduate Student at the University of Washington, studying Library and
                        Information Sciences. I
                        am originally from Minnesota though I have lived in New York City for the past two years. I
                        have
                        experience working in both academic and special libraries, having spent four years working at
                        the
                        Katherine A. Martin Library at the University of Minnesota-Duluth and one semester interning at
                        the
                        Whitney Museum of American Art.
                        <br>
                        <br>This website is dedicated to my Autumn 2018 Directed Field Work. I will be spending this
                        quarter working with the Reference Department at the Long Island University Brooklyn Library.
                        My three learning outcomes (as can be seen in the document below) are to shadow and assist at
                        the reference desk, observe and then lead instructional sessions, and to create necessary
                        LibGuides for the library’s website (which can be accessed on the LibGuides tab). Also found on
                        this site are my weekly reflections. I am very excited to get experience in reference through
                        this DFW, as it is a library area I have not had the opportunity to work in!

                </a>
                <p>As a little introduction: though I have worked in an academic library during my undergrad for three
                    years, I have not had a lot of contact with the reference department. At my school, the circulation
                    desk was near the entrance to the building, with reference being their own desk on the next floor
                    up. Because I was just a student, I was instructed not to answer reference questions, only to
                    direct students to the trained professionals upstairs. I was very excited to hear about this
                    opportunity at the Long Island University Brooklyn because it would allow me to gain experience in
                    a new setting. My MLIS classes have touched on reference work, walking us through the reference
                    interview process and ingraining the importance of open and neutral questions into my mind. I was
                    and am particularly looking forward to being able to shadow real reference librarians and have
                    their insight and mentorship as I start interacting with students.
                    <br>
                    <br> Only students, faculty, staff, and those with official visitor badges are allowed onto the LIU
                    Brooklyn campus. This means that the people one sees in the library are usually the people who will
                    have access to all of the resources because they have identification cards. The library begins on
                    the third floor of the Library Learning Center Building. The main entrance on the third floor holds
                    the Reference Desk, computers and printing stations, a Quiet Room, and a lot of study areas. There
                    are two staircases that lead to the fourth floor, which holds more study spaces, staff offices,
                    Interlibrary Loan, Periodicals, the Archives, and a Language Learning/Tutoring center. Oddly
                    enough, to get to the fifth floor, one must either leave the library on the third floor and take
                    the elevators down the hall, or on the fourth floor one may go through the Language
                    Learning/Tutoring Center to the elevators there. The fifth floor holds the actual books, the
                    Circulation Department, the Media Center, the Instructional Center, study spaces, and
                    Administrative offices.
                    <br>
                    <br>I mention the layout of the building because my first impression was a mix of confusion and
                    amazement. Even with all of my classes in library school, I still associate an academic library
                    with physical items. However, it seems that in the LIU Brooklyn library, it was almost hard to find
                    the physical items. There is a big emphasis on space for students. I spoke with one librarian who
                    offered the idea that because their campus is nonresidential, perhaps they have more of a need for
                    areas for students to get together to hang out and do homework between classes. There are no rules
                    about noise level, plenty of seating for groups and individuals, and though food is discouraged,
                    snacks still find their way into the building. This means that the University’s library is a
                    popular and bustling place. There is a constant low rumble of conversations and students can be
                    seen streaming in and out of the building near constant.
                    <br>
                    <br>The “Ask a Librarian” Reference Desk sits right at the entrance on the third floor. One of the
                    first things I noticed while sitting and observing is that because it is a new semester with new
                    students and classes, the open library setting invites a lot of directional questions. People
                    recognize the library as an information center and rely on the librarian’s within to be able to
                    tell them where they need to go. Unfortunately, I felt as lost as those students when they asked! I
                    was very grateful to have someone who was familiar with the campus to step in and assist.
                    Thankfully it is only week one, and I will have plenty of time to become more knowledgeable about
                    the campus and resources.
                    <br>
                    <br>Another product of the Reference Desk being at the entrance is that it gets asked a lot of
                    basic library questions. We had several students inquiring about the printing location and process,
                    looking for different classrooms in the Instructional Center, and in need of office supplies. Even
                    though times are listed on the door, there were also questions about the library’s hours. People
                    seemed happy to come over to the Reference Desk for advice, even when they could see signage with
                    answers to their questions. I think this says a lot about the approachability people felt towards
                    the librarians here; the students really did seem to believe that the librarians were there to help
                    them, no matter the question. I found that this meant that the librarians needed to not only be
                    experts in their fields, but also experts in the campus. They needed to know where to point
                    students looking to get ID cards, to turn in health forms, those having trouble finding classrooms,
                    as well as showing students how to use the library website and being available for questions via
                    phone, email, or chat. There were a lot of hats being worn by those manning the reference desk.
                    <br>
                    <br>This quarter I have three learning outcomes: shadowing and assisting at the reference desk,
                    observing and leading a library instruction class, and creating a LibGuide for the website. My
                    first week was mostly shadowing the reference desk, as well spending a bit of time getting
                    acquainted with the concept of LibGuides and seeing what areas may be lacking on the LIU Brooklyn
                    Library website. I liked slowly entering into the semester with the shadowing and learning, because
                    they allowed for me to get my bearings on the environment. For my second week, I will be looking
                    more at observing different teaching techniques!
                    <br>
                </p>
                <a class="text-center col-12" id="week2">
                    <h1>Week Two</h1>
                </a>
                <p>
               By the beginning of my second week, I was starting to feel much more comfortable with the tasks I was observing. I had picked up the answers to the more common questions asked of the desk (I had an idea of basic locations, could explain printing, and was able to point out the stapler). I also noticed that I was actively recognizing students who spent a lot of time in the library. My confidence in my environment definitely translated to confidence at my job. My first week I did answer student questions at the desk, but I would also try to direct them to the professional librarian if possible and explain that I may be incorrect. This week, I was tried to be more authoritative and answer the questions I knew the answers to in a manner that did not require other assistance. Of course, had I gotten a complicated question or one that stumped me, I definitely would have turned for help. But, I enjoyed being able to sit and be of some use answering student questions. 
<br>
<br>Another new experience for me this week was starting my teaching observation. I shadowed six one-hour classes taught by three different librarians. I am sure I will go into more exact detail in my personal teaching reflection, but I still want to mention a bit about the classes here in my reflection. 
<br>
<br>LIU Brooklyn’s First Year Seminar (FYS) library training is an approximately fifty minute class on how to use the library. Originally, it was a librarian projecting a screen to students and displaying how to find databases and citations. About five years ago, this was changed to a more interactive learning technique. Today, students participate in a game called “The Amazing Library Race.” Like the TV show, students are put into small groups and given clues. They must complete each set of clues before moving on to the next ones. Whichever team completes all four legs of the race first is awarded a prize. 
<br>
<br>I really enjoyed watching this all play out. During my study abroad course this past summer we had two librarians from Oregon come to speak to us about their library instruction. Similarly, they use games to reinforce library facts as they say interaction promotes better understanding. I think this is shown through “The Amazing Library Race.” Many of the students came in quite lost, unsure of how to get to the classroom. Within the class period, though, they learned the locations of several key area (circulation, media center, computer labs, etc) and what resources the library has to offer. 
<br>
<br>My final reflection of this week comes from one of my previous worries. Going into this directed fieldwork, I had been a little nervous about being the “knowledge center” of the library. To me, reference librarians are magic. They can find you anything you need to know! That is a very tall order to fill. And indeed, I found the reference librarians I came into contact with were every bit as intelligent and skilled as I had anticipated. But what I also noticed is that to be a reference librarian, you don’t actually need to know everything. 
<br>
<br>There are some things librarians are expected to know, but when students come with very specific questions, they did not seem angry or put out that the librarian had to do a bit of research with them to find the answers. One interaction I saw was a student asking about how to determine if her sources were reputable. She explained her subject and went through the sources with the librarian. The student was not surprised that the librarian first had to google the subject to get her bearings on what research would be appropriate for the topic. Instead, it allowed the librarian and the student to discuss the subject together and come up with ideas.
<br>
<br>I had felt this pressure that I needed to know everything right away to be the most helpful. However, after shadowing this week I was relieved to find that instead of needing to be an expert in every field, I just have to be open and ready to look into any topic.
