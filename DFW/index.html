                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a second year online Graduate Student at the University of Washington, studying Library and
                        Information Sciences. I
                        am originally from Minnesota though I have lived in New York City for the past two years. I
                        have
                        experience working in both academic and special libraries, having spent four years working at
                        the
                        Katherine A. Martin Library at the University of Minnesota-Duluth and one semester interning at
                        the
                        Whitney Museum of American Art.
                        <br>
                        <br>This website is dedicated to my Autumn 2018 Directed Field Work. I will be spending this
                        quarter working with the Reference Department at the Long Island University Brooklyn Library.
                        My three learning outcomes (as can be seen in the document below) are to shadow and assist at
                        the reference desk, observe and then lead instructional sessions, and to create necessary
                        LibGuides for the library’s website (which can be accessed on the LibGuides tab). Also found on
                        this site are my weekly reflections. I am very excited to get experience in reference through
                        this DFW, as it is a library area I have not had the opportunity to work in!

                    <h1>Week One: Introduction to the Library</h1>
                </a>
                <p>
                    <br>As a little introduction: though I have worked in an academic library during my undergrad for three
                    years, I have not had a lot of contact with the reference department. At my school, the circulation
                    desk was near the entrance to the building, with reference being their own desk on the next floor
                    up. Because I was just a student, I was instructed not to answer reference questions, only to
                    direct students to the trained professionals upstairs. I was very excited to hear about this
                    opportunity at the Long Island University Brooklyn because it would allow me to gain experience in
                    a new setting. My MLIS classes have touched on reference work, walking us through the reference
                    interview process and ingraining the importance of open and neutral questions into my mind. I was
                    and am particularly looking forward to being able to shadow real reference librarians and have
                    their insight and mentorship as I start interacting with students.
                    <br>
                    <br> Only students, faculty, staff, and those with official visitor badges are allowed onto the LIU
                    Brooklyn campus. This means that the people one sees in the library are usually the people who will
                    have access to all of the resources because they have identification cards. The library begins on
                    the third floor of the Library Learning Center Building. The main entrance on the third floor holds
                    the Reference Desk, computers and printing stations, a Quiet Room, and a lot of study areas. There
                    are two staircases that lead to the fourth floor, which holds more study spaces, staff offices,
                    Interlibrary Loan, Periodicals, the Archives, and a Language Learning/Tutoring center. Oddly
                    enough, to get to the fifth floor, one must either leave the library on the third floor and take
                    the elevators down the hall, or on the fourth floor one may go through the Language
                    Learning/Tutoring Center to the elevators there. The fifth floor holds the actual books, the
                    Circulation Department, the Media Center, the Instructional Center, study spaces, and
                    Administrative offices.
                    <br>
                    <br>I mention the layout of the building because my first impression was a mix of confusion and
                    amazement. Even with all of my classes in library school, I still associate an academic library
                    with physical items. However, it seems that in the LIU Brooklyn library, it was almost hard to find
                    the physical items. There is a big emphasis on space for students. I spoke with one librarian who
                    offered the idea that because their campus is nonresidential, perhaps they have more of a need for
                    areas for students to get together to hang out and do homework between classes. There are no rules
                    about noise level, plenty of seating for groups and individuals, and though food is discouraged,
                    snacks still find their way into the building. This means that the University’s library is a
                    popular and bustling place. There is a constant low rumble of conversations and students can be
                    seen streaming in and out of the building near constant.
                    <br>
                    <br>The “Ask a Librarian” Reference Desk sits right at the entrance on the third floor. One of the
                    first things I noticed while sitting and observing is that because it is a new semester with new
                    students and classes, the open library setting invites a lot of directional questions. People
                    recognize the library as an information center and rely on the librarian’s within to be able to
                    tell them where they need to go. Unfortunately, I felt as lost as those students when they asked! I
                    was very grateful to have someone who was familiar with the campus to step in and assist.
                    Thankfully it is only week one, and I will have plenty of time to become more knowledgeable about
                    the campus and resources.
                    <br>
                    <br>Another product of the Reference Desk being at the entrance is that it gets asked a lot of
                    basic library questions. We had several students inquiring about the printing location and process,
                    looking for different classrooms in the Instructional Center, and in need of office supplies. Even
                    though times are listed on the door, there were also questions about the library’s hours. People
                    seemed happy to come over to the Reference Desk for advice, even when they could see signage with
                    answers to their questions. I think this says a lot about the approachability people felt towards
                    the librarians here; the students really did seem to believe that the librarians were there to help
                    them, no matter the question. I found that this meant that the librarians needed to not only be
                    experts in their fields, but also experts in the campus. They needed to know where to point
                    students looking to get ID cards, to turn in health forms, those having trouble finding classrooms,
                    as well as showing students how to use the library website and being available for questions via
                    phone, email, or chat. There were a lot of hats being worn by those manning the reference desk.
                    <br>
                    <br>This quarter I have three learning outcomes: shadowing and assisting at the reference desk,
                    observing and leading a library instruction class, and creating a LibGuide for the website. My
                    first week was mostly shadowing the reference desk, as well spending a bit of time getting
                    acquainted with the concept of LibGuides and seeing what areas may be lacking on the LIU Brooklyn
                    Library website. I liked slowly entering into the semester with the shadowing and learning, because
                    they allowed for me to get my bearings on the environment. For my second week, I will be looking
                    more at observing different teaching techniques!
                    <br>
                </p>
                <a class="text-center col-12" id="week2">
                    <h1>Week Two: Reference Desk and Library Instruction</h1>
                </a>
                <p>
                    <br>By the beginning of my second week, I was starting to feel much more comfortable with the tasks I
                    was observing. I had picked up the answers to the more common questions asked of the desk (I had an
                    idea of basic locations, could explain printing, and was able to point out the stapler). I also
                    noticed that I was actively recognizing students who spent a lot of time in the library. My
                    confidence in my environment definitely translated to confidence at my job. My first week I did
                    answer student questions at the desk, but I would also try to direct them to the professional
                    librarian if possible and explain that I may be incorrect. This week, I was tried to be more
                    authoritative and answer the questions I knew the answers to in a manner that did not require other
                    assistance. Of course, had I gotten a complicated question or one that stumped me, I definitely
                    would have turned for help. But, I enjoyed being able to sit and be of some use answering student
                    questions.
                    <br>
                    <br>Another new experience for me this week was starting my teaching observation. I shadowed six
                    one-hour classes taught by three different librarians. I am sure I will go into more exact detail
                    in my personal teaching reflection, but I still want to mention a bit about the classes here in my
                    reflection.
                    <br>
                    <br>LIU Brooklyn’s First Year Seminar (FYS) library training is an approximately fifty minute class
                    on how to use the library. Originally, it was a librarian projecting a screen to students and
                    displaying how to find databases and citations. About five years ago, this was changed to a more
                    interactive learning technique. Today, students participate in a game called “The Amazing Library
                    Race.” Like the TV show, students are put into small groups and given clues. They must complete
                    each set of clues before moving on to the next ones. Whichever team completes all four legs of the
                    race first is awarded a prize.
                    <br>
                    <br>I really enjoyed watching this all play out. During my study abroad course this past summer we
                    had two librarians from Oregon come to speak to us about their library instruction. Similarly, they
                    use games to reinforce library facts as they say interaction promotes better understanding. I think
                    this is shown through “The Amazing Library Race.” Many of the students came in quite lost, unsure
                    of how to get to the classroom. Within the class period, though, they learned the locations of
                    several key area (circulation, media center, computer labs, etc) and what resources the library has
                    to offer.
                    <br>
                    <br>My final reflection of this week comes from one of my previous worries. Going into this
                    directed fieldwork, I had been a little nervous about being the “knowledge center” of the library.
                    To me, reference librarians are magic. They can find you anything you need to know! That is a very
                    tall order to fill. And indeed, I found the reference librarians I came into contact with were
                    every bit as intelligent and skilled as I had anticipated. But what I also noticed is that to be a
                    reference librarian, you don’t actually need to know everything.
                    <br>
                    <br>There are some things librarians are expected to know, but when students come with very
                    specific questions, they did not seem angry or put out that the librarian had to do a bit of
                    research with them to find the answers. One interaction I saw was a student asking about how to
                    determine if her sources were reputable. She explained her subject and went through the sources
                    with the librarian. The student was not surprised that the librarian first had to google the
                    subject to get her bearings on what research would be appropriate for the topic. Instead, it
                    allowed the librarian and the student to discuss the subject together and come up with ideas.
                    <br>
                    <br>I had felt this pressure that I needed to know everything right away to be the most helpful.
                    However, after shadowing this week I was relieved to find that instead of needing to be an expert
                    in every field, I just have to be open and ready to look into any topic.
                    <br>

                <a class="text-center col-12" id="week3">
                    <h1>Week Three: Library Instruction</h1>
                </a>
                <p> <br>Library Instruction was a task I was quite nervous to delve into. My previous library
                    instruction experience has only been as a student, going through basic library functions in my
                    Freshman Seminar and Composition classes during my undergrad. Added to this was the previously
                    mentioned talk by library instructors I was present for during my study abroad course this past
                    Early Fall. When Library Instruction was offered as a possible learning outcome by my DFW
                    supervisor, I was unsure of what exactly this would entail, but more than willing to give it a go.
                    <br>
                    <br>For the past two weeks, most of my instructional observation has been on the First Year Seminar
                    (FYS) Library Introduction, a relay race entitled “The Amazing Library Race.” I observed four
                    different instructors leading multiple classes of new freshman through a race about the library and
                    its materials. At the end of my second week, I was able to step in and co-lead a class with a
                    librarian. I assisted in giving instructions and passing out clues as teams returned. This was the
                    perfect introduction for me, as it allowed me to test my instructional knowledge with a back-up for
                    anything I forgot. I was a bit nervous, so some of the details did slip my mind, and the librarian
                    was there to make sure the students got all of the information. While I was running the race, it
                    was also clear to the students that the librarian was my supervisor, and they would bring their
                    answers to her before showing them to me. Overall, having the opportunity to co-lead allowed me to
                    test my skills while also having a safety net when necessary.
                    <br>
                    <br>By this week, I was very comfortable in the structure of the FYS classes. I lead my first solo
                    Amazing Library Race session on Wednesday, following it up with another session on Thursday. Both
                    went well, and when reflecting on them I do not think there was any information I had forgotten to
                    give to the students. Although it was nice to co-lead, teaching a class on my own was good because
                    I was forced into a true leadership role. I was fully in charge, from set up to take down. Finally,
                    teaching races helped me to feel like a part of the reference team. I was able to help out, picking
                    up a class that needed a new instructor. It is always a good feeling when you know you are helping.
                    <br>
                    <br>I do not have a public speaking phobia, but many times having to speak in front of groups makes
                    me nervous. I was surprised to find that with the library instruction, once I got into the groove,
                    this anxiety just melted away. I had sit through enough classes to know what to say, how to give
                    hints, and what to expect from the students. When looking back at my week, I noted that I was
                    genuinely happy with the teaching experience. In fact, it is now something that I would think about
                    pursuing in my future career. I don’t know if I would want to be a full-time library instructor,
                    but my limited classroom time at LIU Brooklyn has showed me that it would be an element to a future
                    job that I would enjoy.
                    <br>
                    <br>There are still other classes that I am going to observe. I have watched an English 16 (basic
                    composition) class, which involved actual database searching and instruction, rather than a library
                    overview. This in-depth look on how and what to search is more akin to my previous library
                    instruction experience. I am hoping to get to sit in on other, more advanced classes as well.
                    Perhaps if I learn enough from observation, I can begin to co-lead or even fully teach one of these
                    other sessions!

                    <h1>Week Four: LibGuides</h1>
                </a>
                <p>
                    <br>Technology and web skills are crucial for academic librarians. Librarians are known for being
                    able
                    to search different areas for information; what many may not realize is that often librarians
                    contribute to the websites they may be searching. LibGuides are a popular content management system
                    for libraries to create web pages. In layman’s terms, LibGuides are web templates that libraries
                    can add their own information to.
                    <br>
                    <br> In order to gain as many of the necessary technology skills to work in an academic library,
                    part of
                    my learning outcomes in my Directed Fieldwork is creating LibGuides for the LIU Brooklyn Library’s
                    website. To prepare, I spent the first couple weeks looking through the LibGuides currently on the
                    site. I noted which subjects and courses had pages, clicking through and seeing the formats. I also
                    compared these guides to those featured on by Springshare, the company that owns LibGuides, on
                    their own website.
                    <br>
                    <br>My advisor and I each came up with possible LibGuides that I could create during the quarter.
                    After
                    some discussion, we settled on one academic LibGuides for a course and one lifestyle LibGuide for
                    all students and faculty. For my fourth week I focused on beginning to write, style, and format my
                    academic guide. Armed with the class syllabus and access to other class guides, I prepared to
                    complete a page for OT [Occupational Therapy] 306: Therapy Skills.
                    <br>
                    <br>LibGuides pages are fairly easy to create. Thankfully, there are also a lot of instructional
                    videos
                    on Youtube to show how to do nearly any task! Along with this, LIU Brooklyn Library has a specific
                    style format for all of their pages, so I did not have to worry about creating color schemes. I
                    just had to decide what pages were necessary, what should be on those pages, and then create or
                    find the information to include.
                    <br>
                    <br>I ended up working a lot on the content and formatting. I was surprised at how my limited
                    coding
                    skills made my pages look so much nicer. I decided to not only create my own boxes, but copied and
                    reformatted boxes from other LIU Brooklyn Library pages, inserted videos, and added images. In the
                    end, I felt very confident that my pages were informative, varied, and relevant. My advisor gave me
                    feedback at the midway point and as I was nearing the end of my page. Because of this feedback, I
                    am entering into my fifth week with slight alterations still to make to my pages to bring them up
                    to professional standard.
                    <br>
                    <br>Before this DFW, LibGuides was something I knew existed, but was not something I had a lot of
                    knowledge about. Considering the amount of time I was allowed to learn, play with, and change my
                    page, I am very glad that I was able to begin my LibGuide experience in a learning environment. I
                    know that this is a highly valuable skill for employed librarians and will probably be a task I
                    complete in future work.

                    <h1>Week Five: Class Observation</h1>
                </a>
                <p>
                    <br>As midterms approach at LIU Brooklyn, more and more classes have been scheduling instructional
                    classes at the library. This week, in addition to sitting at the Reference Desk and working on my
                    LibGuides, I observed four classes: two were English 16 classes (basic composition) with different
                    instructors, one was a Core Seminar class (another basic writing class, focused more on evaluating
                    sources than the technicalities of writing), and one was for Law 211 (writing using law cases). I
                    had previously sat in on an English 16 and a Core Seminar class, taught by different instructors
                    than this week.
                    <br>
                    <br>Through all of my observation, I picked up that there are certain things that every instructor
                    does, and certain little bits they do to make their classes unique. Every instructor began the
                    class with a basic introduction to the library. No matter the majors or years, every class seemed
                    like a mix of people who had been to the library before and those who had not. Instructors would
                    explain the library’s web site and the differences between books, ebooks, and articles. Each
                    instructor also would show how to search both the catalog and the database list.
                    <br>
                    <br>Before each class the instructors had looked through the syllabus and the assignments the
                    students were working on. They usually had already done some preliminary searches, figuring out the
                    best keywords and databases to use. This is not to say that they did not improvise or change things
                    in class, just that they came prepared with searches they knew would be good examples. They would
                    also have prepared an activity for the class to work on. Typically they tried to tie this to the
                    class assignment. For example, in one of the English 16 classes the students were given a sheet to
                    help evaluate articles they found. They were instructed to find at least one relevant article to
                    their topic and email it to themselves and their teacher. Hopefully, having this source would help
                    them as they started writing their paper.
                    <br>
                    <br>There are many small variances between teaching styles. Each instructor has created his/her own
                    activities for the group, so these may differ slightly. When one instructor for English 16 found
                    that none of the students had experience with call numbers, she took the whole class into the
                    circulation area to demonstrate how to find a book in the stacks. Overall, though there may be
                    differences, by the end of each class it seemed like students not only had a better grasp on the
                    library and its resources, but also had a good idea of where to start their research.
                    <br>
                    <br>My goal is to start to take a more active role in these instructional classes. Now that the
                    First Year Seminar classes are winding down, the classes will be more focused on actual research
                    methods and techniques. With additional observation in the coming weeks, my Directed Fieldwork
                    Supervisor and I hope that I can start to step in to co-teach some of the more common instructional
                    classes.

                <a class="text-center col-12" id="week6">
                    <h1>Week Six: Mid-Quarter</h1>
                </a>
                <p>
                    <br>This week marks being halfway through the quarter. That means my supervisor and I took time this
                    week to sit and complete the Mid-Quarter Report and reflect on how things have gone so far.

                    <br>
                    <br>In just six weeks, I have accomplished a lot of my Learning Outcomes. First, I have observed
                    interactions at the Reference Desk. This was very informative as I have not previously worked in
                    reference. I have become comfortable and competent enough that I have been able to staff the desk
                    alone a few times, answering student questions and assisting in research. Second, I have shadowed
                    many different library instruction classes, from First Year Seminar to Journalism to Law classes.
                    Here, I have been able to begin teaching a First Year Seminar on my own. This has been great, not
                    only because it is a fun experience, but also because I have been able to step in and assist when
                    needed. Third, and last, I have successfully created multiple LibGuides for the LIU Brooklyn
                    Library page. Before this, I knew what LibGuides were, but I had not had any experience with
                    working on them personally. There was a bit of a learning curve, but with time and feedback, I now
                    have two professional-level guides for students. Looking at all of these accomplishments, I am
                    proud of how much I have done in just half of my Directed Field Work time.

                    <br>
                    <br>It is midterm for the Long Island University Brooklyn students, too. I see this at the Reference
                    Desk with the sheer number of students in and out of the library building. As the semester
                    progresses, more and more students are spending time working and studying in the library. During
                    the first few weeks there were indeed students in the library, but many of them could be found
                    sitting in groups and socializing. Now, one still has groups who are just hanging out, but more
                    often than that, one will see students sitting alone or in small groups, heads bent over notebooks
                    and computers. There is a steady stream of students entering and leaving, even earlier in the
                    morning.

                    <br>
                    <br>With the increase in students, there has been an increase in research questions. At the beginning
                    of the quarter, I saw a lot of students coming to the Ask-A-Librarian desk for directions and more
                    basic questions (such as, how/where do I print?). Increasingly, students coming up to the desk will
                    have an assignment in hand and ask more detailed questions. This has been very helpful, as I can
                    watch the librarian-on-duty’s search techniques and review research tips.

                    <br>
                    <br>As new students are getting more comfortable in the campus, First Year Seminar classes are winding
                    down. Instead, I am seeing more advanced classes coming in for library sessions. These classes are
                    focused on preparing for their final assignments. Though there is a library resources overview, a
                    lot of these classes are centered around how to find the best results for their particular field.
                    For example, in a Law class I observed, the instructor showed some of the Law databases, as well as
                    how to best craft keywords to get relevant results.

                    <br>
                    <br>Of course, a reflection of the past half of the quarter would not be complete without a note of
                    what I hope for the next half. In the coming five weeks, there is still a lot I am hoping to do.
                    Per my Learning Outcomes, I will complete my interaction reflections and teaching reflection. As I
                    continue to sit at the Reference Desk, I hope to interact with more students. I am also hoping that
                    with final assignments coming up, I will be able to provide more research-specific assistance. I am
                    currently waiting on final approval before my LibGuides will be published to the LIU Brooklyn
                    Library site. Next, I will be turning my attention to updating and reformatting some of the popular
                    handouts for the classes. Finally, with less First Year Seminar classes to teach, I am planning on
                    starting to co-teach some of the English 16 classes. These are basic composition classes, with the
                    instructor showing students the library resources and basic search techniques. Depending on how
                    many classes I shadow, I may or may not begin co-teaching other classes as well.

                    <br>
                    <br>Thus far, I have learned an incredible amount from this DFW. I would highly recommend the
                    experience and this location to others wanting to learn more about academic library work.

                <p>
                    <br>For some students, visiting a reference desk is viewed as intimidating. Perhaps this is because
                    they are worried about appearing stupid or because they are not quite sure of what exactly they
                    want or are looking for. For others, barriers such as limited time or a faraway location can turn
                    having to ask for help into a chore. Being able to instantly connect with a librarian via chat can
                    be helpful in both of these scenarios. Chat gives students more anonymity, allowing them to ask
                    their questions without fear of the librarian later recognizing and judging them. Chat also allows
                    for students to get quick answers from wherever they happen to be. The ability to chat with a
                    librarian opens students up to librarians on the student’s time and at the student’s discretion.
                    Personally, I just use chats to either express a problem to a company or to answer a small question
                    very quickly. What I found from my first shadowing of a chat encounter was much more of an
                    interaction than I had been expecting.
                    <br>
                    <br>The LibChat window is always open at the Reference Desk. When a new inquiry comes in, the
                    computer emits a ping sound and the top tab flashes to get the librarian’s attention. The first
                    chat that I witnessed came from a student, whom I have renamed Rose here, asking if she could print
                    in color at the library. The Reference Desk librarian immediately noticed when the new chat popped
                    up and replied that unfortunately there is not color printing anywhere on campus. This is
                    apparently a pretty common request, so I was shown by the librarian to direct students to a
                    printing store near campus. He offered Rose the information on the business, including their
                    website, price, and location. At first, we both believed that this would probably be the end of the
                    interaction. The chat is left open, as the librarian I shadowed explained that chats are not closed
                    on the library’s side until the student has closed it on their side.
                    <br>
                    <br>Here is where the interaction took the turn that I found compelling. Rose continued the
                    interaction, asking if the place was currently open and where it was, if it was far from the
                    school. The librarian stated that the print shop was about a five minute walk from campus. Rose
                    next explained that she was working on an assignment and only had a few pages. She asked if the
                    print shop had a page minimum for printing or if they did single pages. The librarian wrote back
                    that according to the website there was no minimum (the site had a per page price and no previous
                    students had mentioned a minimum. He also provided Rose with a phone number in case she had any
                    other questions.
                    <br>
                    <br>At this point we were again assuming that the conversation was most likely finished. There was
                    no response from Rose after this final bit of information and her chat box stayed open. My pure
                    speculation would be that she left the library page open while she went and did her printing. About
                    forty-five minutes later, the chat went inactive, with the chat box changing color from green to
                    red indicating that Rose had signed off.
                    <br>
                    <br>It would be expected for students to ask librarians questions about the library and its
                    services. What I found to be so interesting was that rather than cutting off the conversation after
                    getting the initial information, Rose continued to ask questions. Along with that, her questions
                    were ones that had theoretically been answered in the first response, when the librarian shared the
                    website with her. She trusted the librarian to have full knowledge of the establishment he was
                    pointing her to, which was a fair expectation that proved to be true. Through his own past
                    experience of the printing shop, as well as with utilizing the shop’s own website, the librarian
                    was able to answer all of Rose’s questions. The ease of use for the chat system almost turned the
                    librarian into a “Google” for Rose to ask her questions of.
                    <br>
                    <br>The ability of the librarian to answer all of Rose’s questions, as well as the fact that Rose
                    did not chat later with follow-up questions leads me to believe that this was a successful
                    reference interaction. The asker was able to get the necessary information to her question and I do
                    not have a way for this to have been improved upon in this specific case.

                    <h1>Interaction Two</h1>
                </a>
                <p>
                    <br> Librarians are the societal keepers of knowledge; we help people find what they need to know.
                    Unfortunately, sometimes people come to us expecting that our ability to find their answers means
                    that we will automatically do all of their work for them. Such seemed to be the case for my second
                    interaction reflection.
                    <br>
                    <br> At the Reference Desk, we were aware that a class had given an assignment for students to look
                    into specific topics, as we had already had a couple groups come in asking for assistance. Our last
                    group looking for help was four first year students. Their teacher had asked them to look into
                    bullying, requiring them to come up with five resources from the library to use in their research.
                    The group approached the desk and simply asked for the librarian to find them these resources.
                    Their body language (standing a bit away from the desk, fidgeting as if they wanted to leave,
                    talking amongst themselves) indicated they were hoping for a quick answer.
                    <br>
                    <br>The librarian used this as a learning exercise. She asked them how familiar they were with the
                    library’s site and resources. They all replied that they did not know much about how or where to
                    find materials. The librarian showed them the library’s website and how to search the catalog. She
                    quickly explained how keyword searches worked, offering different possible search terms they could
                    look into. The librarian showed them a few of the possible books to be checked out, noting the call
                    numbers and explaining that in the Library of Congress classification system, books of the same
                    subject are usually grouped together.
                    <br>
                    <br> In order to help them find the best books, the librarian then asked what their specific
                    research topic was. The students had not yet thought of a specific topic within bullying, and
                    debated for a few minutes. During this time, you could see them starting to get more comfortable
                    with spending time at the reference desk. One girl sat down at the chair by the desk, one took out
                    a notebook, and the other two physically moved closer to hear. Because there was a lot of material
                    on it, the group settled on cyber bullying. The librarian showed them the call numbers for books on
                    this, which they wrote down.
                    <br>
                    <br>With their list of required books completed, the librarian offered to help them find articles.
                    The girls explained that according to the assignment, they just needed any five sources. The
                    librarian challenged them to look at their topic a little deeper. Yes, they only needed to find
                    five sources, but since they were here with help, why not take full advantage? It is hard to
                    describe, but the way that she spoke with them was not pushy. She managed to offer her assistance
                    without making the students feel like they had no choice in the matter. She came off as genuine in
                    her desire to get the group the best resources for their assignment.
                    <br>
                    <br>One girl, who appeared to be the group leader, suggested that her group just stay and look for
                    articles with the librarian. Her reasoning echoed the librarian’s point, that her group might as
                    well get as many sources they could. The girls huddled around the librarian’s computer as she
                    walked them through the steps to searching the library’s databases. By the end of the interaction,
                    the group had multiple book call numbers, knew that there would be similarly subjected books next
                    to the books they were searching for, understood how to search databases, and had a list of
                    keywords to plug into databases that would yield relevant results.
                    <br>
                    <br>As said previously, some students come to a librarian hoping that by doing so they have avoided
                    the necessity of doing a lot of their own work. This has been noted as an issue with reference
                    desks in my classes. I chose to write about this interaction because it seemed to highlight this
                    problem, but ultimately resulted in the students engaging with the librarian. I was impressed at
                    how the librarian handled the group of students wanting to be handed a list of perfect sources,
                    teaching the group how the library website worked. Not only this, but the librarian was able to
                    take their broad subject matter and help them narrow it to a more manageable research topic. What
                    had started as a group of people haphazardly standing by a desk asking for answers morphed into a
                    group of students actively searching with a librarian to find the best materials for their topic.
                    <br>
                    <br>From this I learned that students are open to the learning experience. My past worry had been
                    that if a student expected, but was not given, quick and easy answers, he/she would become either
                    bored or annoyed. This still may be true, but from the interactions that I have witnessed at the
                    LIU Brooklyn Reference Desk, it appears that students do understand that by approaching a librarian
                    they are engaging in a two-way interaction.

                <a class="text-center col-12" id="interaction3">
                    <h1>Interaction Three</h1>
                </a>
                <p>
                    <br>After three and a half weeks of observation at the LIU Brooklyn Library’s Reference Desk, I had
                    become much more confident answering questions and guiding patrons through the library’s resources.
                    Furthermore, I became much more comfortable with the doing these tasks without direct supervision.
                    When an opportunity to sit alone at the Reference Desk during a staff meeting hour popped up, I was
                    more than happy to step in and help. This reflection is focused on an interaction I had assisting a
                    student while acting as the Reference Librarian at the Reference Desk.
                    <br>
                    <br>During my time alone, I was approached by a student who was looking for information about
                    Google Scholar. I offered to walk her through the website. The student sat on a stool across from
                    me and I turned my screen so we could both see. I navigated to scholar.google.com, saying that she
                    could also go to google and search “scholar”to find the site. She had a topic in mind, a very
                    technical nursing term, so we used her keywords to search. I scrolled through the results page,
                    highlighting how Google Scholar will label each item in brackets ( [Article], [Book], etc.).
                    <br>
                    <br>As we went through the Google Scholar site, I pointed out that on the right of the articles
                    were different ways to find the full text. Some had buttons linking to the article from other
                    websites and some had a “Find FullText @ LIU” button. I demonstrated clicking this button, which
                    allowed us access to the article through the LIU databases automatically because we were on campus.
                    I explained that she would have similar access to these resources at home, but in order for the LIU
                    button to appear, she needed to ensure that before she searched on Google Scholar she signed in to
                    her LIU account either through her email or the library website. Before I finished our interaction,
                    I made sure to ask if there was anything else she needed to search or any other assistance
                    required. She seemed very happy with the information provided and went back to her work station.
                    As I have mentioned before in other reflections, it is impossible for a librarian to be an expert
                    on every field. This proved to be the case here, as the student was studying a highly technical
                    nursing term that I was unfamiliar with. I enjoyed showing her Google Scholar, though, and I
                    genuinely felt like she was able to take away applicable knowledge. The one thing that I would
                    change would be to have taken time to familiarize myself more with the topic. By knowing more about
                    what I was searching for, perhaps I could have been a better judge of the quality of the resources.
                    As I have seen in most cases at the Reference Desk, the student asking for assistance was open to
                    direction and happy to take the time to learn from what I was saying. She took notes on what I was
                    doing and asked relevant questions (such as if it was possible to find these sources at her home).
                    <br>
                    <br>An unforeseen benefit to this interaction was that it lead into a Core Seminar class I observed
                    later. During this class, students are given time to search for sources on a topic and asked to
                    evaluate how trustworthy these sources are. Due to the large number of questions, I stepped in to
                    aid the teacher and instructor, answering students’ search questions. Another student asked me how
                    Google Scholar worked and I was able to quickly go through the same sort of presentation I had
                    showed to the student at the Reference Desk. In a later class, the Library Instructor also showed
                    the class how to operate Google Scholar. It became clear to me that while students may know of
                    Google Scholar’s existence, they may require some help on how to best use it.
