                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a second year online Graduate Student at the University of Washington, studying Library and
                        Information Sciences. I
                        am originally from Minnesota though I have lived in New York City for the past two years. I
                        have
                        experience working in both academic and special libraries, having spent four years working at
                        the
                        Katherine A. Martin Library at the University of Minnesota-Duluth and one semester interning at
                        the
                        Whitney Museum of American Art.
                        <br>
                        <br>This website is dedicated to my Autumn 2018 Directed Field Work. I will be spending this
                        quarter working with the Reference Department at the Long Island University Brooklyn Library.
                        My three learning outcomes (as can be seen in the document below) are to shadow and assist at
                        the reference desk, observe and then lead instructional sessions, and to create necessary
                        LibGuides for the library’s website (which can be accessed on the LibGuides tab). Also found on
                        this site are my weekly reflections. I am very excited to get experience in reference through
                        this DFW, as it is a library area I have not had the opportunity to work in!

                </a>
                <p>As a little introduction: though I have worked in an academic library during my undergrad for three
                    years, I have not had a lot of contact with the reference department. At my school, the circulation
                    desk was near the entrance to the building, with reference being their own desk on the next floor
                    up. Because I was just a student, I was instructed not to answer reference questions, only to
                    direct students to the trained professionals upstairs. I was very excited to hear about this
                    opportunity at the Long Island University Brooklyn because it would allow me to gain experience in
                    a new setting. My MLIS classes have touched on reference work, walking us through the reference
                    interview process and ingraining the importance of open and neutral questions into my mind. I was
                    and am particularly looking forward to being able to shadow real reference librarians and have
                    their insight and mentorship as I start interacting with students.
                    <br>
                    <br> Only students, faculty, staff, and those with official visitor badges are allowed onto the LIU
                    Brooklyn campus. This means that the people one sees in the library are usually the people who will
                    have access to all of the resources because they have identification cards. The library begins on
                    the third floor of the Library Learning Center Building. The main entrance on the third floor holds
                    the Reference Desk, computers and printing stations, a Quiet Room, and a lot of study areas. There
                    are two staircases that lead to the fourth floor, which holds more study spaces, staff offices,
                    Interlibrary Loan, Periodicals, the Archives, and a Language Learning/Tutoring center. Oddly
                    enough, to get to the fifth floor, one must either leave the library on the third floor and take
                    the elevators down the hall, or on the fourth floor one may go through the Language
                    Learning/Tutoring Center to the elevators there. The fifth floor holds the actual books, the
                    Circulation Department, the Media Center, the Instructional Center, study spaces, and
                    Administrative offices.
                    <br>
                    <br>I mention the layout of the building because my first impression was a mix of confusion and
                    amazement. Even with all of my classes in library school, I still associate an academic library
                    with physical items. However, it seems that in the LIU Brooklyn library, it was almost hard to find
                    the physical items. There is a big emphasis on space for students. I spoke with one librarian who
                    offered the idea that because their campus is nonresidential, perhaps they have more of a need for
                    areas for students to get together to hang out and do homework between classes. There are no rules
                    about noise level, plenty of seating for groups and individuals, and though food is discouraged,
                    snacks still find their way into the building. This means that the University’s library is a
                    popular and bustling place. There is a constant low rumble of conversations and students can be
                    seen streaming in and out of the building near constant.
                    <br>
                    <br>The “Ask a Librarian” Reference Desk sits right at the entrance on the third floor. One of the
                    first things I noticed while sitting and observing is that because it is a new semester with new
                    students and classes, the open library setting invites a lot of directional questions. People
                    recognize the library as an information center and rely on the librarian’s within to be able to
                    tell them where they need to go. Unfortunately, I felt as lost as those students when they asked! I
                    was very grateful to have someone who was familiar with the campus to step in and assist.
                    Thankfully it is only week one, and I will have plenty of time to become more knowledgeable about
                    the campus and resources.
                    <br>
                    <br>Another product of the Reference Desk being at the entrance is that it gets asked a lot of
                    basic library questions. We had several students inquiring about the printing location and process,
                    looking for different classrooms in the Instructional Center, and in need of office supplies. Even
                    though times are listed on the door, there were also questions about the library’s hours. People
                    seemed happy to come over to the Reference Desk for advice, even when they could see signage with
                    answers to their questions. I think this says a lot about the approachability people felt towards
                    the librarians here; the students really did seem to believe that the librarians were there to help
                    them, no matter the question. I found that this meant that the librarians needed to not only be
                    experts in their fields, but also experts in the campus. They needed to know where to point
                    students looking to get ID cards, to turn in health forms, those having trouble finding classrooms,
                    as well as showing students how to use the library website and being available for questions via
                    phone, email, or chat. There were a lot of hats being worn by those manning the reference desk.
                    <br>
                    <br>This quarter I have three learning outcomes: shadowing and assisting at the reference desk,
                    observing and leading a library instruction class, and creating a LibGuide for the website. My
                    first week was mostly shadowing the reference desk, as well spending a bit of time getting
                    acquainted with the concept of LibGuides and seeing what areas may be lacking on the LIU Brooklyn
                    Library website. I liked slowly entering into the semester with the shadowing and learning, because
                    they allowed for me to get my bearings on the environment. For my second week, I will be looking
                    more at observing different teaching techniques!
                    <br>
                </p>
                <a class="text-center col-12" id="week2">
                    <h1>Week Two</h1>
                </a>
                <p>
                    By the beginning of my second week, I was starting to feel much more comfortable with the tasks I
                    was observing. I had picked up the answers to the more common questions asked of the desk (I had an
                    idea of basic locations, could explain printing, and was able to point out the stapler). I also
                    noticed that I was actively recognizing students who spent a lot of time in the library. My
                    confidence in my environment definitely translated to confidence at my job. My first week I did
                    answer student questions at the desk, but I would also try to direct them to the professional
                    librarian if possible and explain that I may be incorrect. This week, I was tried to be more
                    authoritative and answer the questions I knew the answers to in a manner that did not require other
                    assistance. Of course, had I gotten a complicated question or one that stumped me, I definitely
                    would have turned for help. But, I enjoyed being able to sit and be of some use answering student
                    questions.
                    <br>
                    <br>Another new experience for me this week was starting my teaching observation. I shadowed six
                    one-hour classes taught by three different librarians. I am sure I will go into more exact detail
                    in my personal teaching reflection, but I still want to mention a bit about the classes here in my
                    reflection.
                    <br>
                    <br>LIU Brooklyn’s First Year Seminar (FYS) library training is an approximately fifty minute class
                    on how to use the library. Originally, it was a librarian projecting a screen to students and
                    displaying how to find databases and citations. About five years ago, this was changed to a more
                    interactive learning technique. Today, students participate in a game called “The Amazing Library
                    Race.” Like the TV show, students are put into small groups and given clues. They must complete
                    each set of clues before moving on to the next ones. Whichever team completes all four legs of the
                    race first is awarded a prize.
                    <br>
                    <br>I really enjoyed watching this all play out. During my study abroad course this past summer we
                    had two librarians from Oregon come to speak to us about their library instruction. Similarly, they
                    use games to reinforce library facts as they say interaction promotes better understanding. I think
                    this is shown through “The Amazing Library Race.” Many of the students came in quite lost, unsure
                    of how to get to the classroom. Within the class period, though, they learned the locations of
                    several key area (circulation, media center, computer labs, etc) and what resources the library has
                    to offer.
                    <br>
                    <br>My final reflection of this week comes from one of my previous worries. Going into this
                    directed fieldwork, I had been a little nervous about being the “knowledge center” of the library.
                    To me, reference librarians are magic. They can find you anything you need to know! That is a very
                    tall order to fill. And indeed, I found the reference librarians I came into contact with were
                    every bit as intelligent and skilled as I had anticipated. But what I also noticed is that to be a
                    reference librarian, you don’t actually need to know everything.
                    <br>
                    <br>There are some things librarians are expected to know, but when students come with very
                    specific questions, they did not seem angry or put out that the librarian had to do a bit of
                    research with them to find the answers. One interaction I saw was a student asking about how to
                    determine if her sources were reputable. She explained her subject and went through the sources
                    with the librarian. The student was not surprised that the librarian first had to google the
                    subject to get her bearings on what research would be appropriate for the topic. Instead, it
                    allowed the librarian and the student to discuss the subject together and come up with ideas.
                    <br>
                    <br>I had felt this pressure that I needed to know everything right away to be the most helpful.
                    However, after shadowing this week I was relieved to find that instead of needing to be an expert
                    in every field, I just have to be open and ready to look into any topic.

<p>
    <br>For some students, visiting a reference desk is viewed as intimidating. Perhaps this is because they are worried about appearing stupid or because they are not quite sure of what exactly they want or are looking for. For others, barriers such as limited time or a faraway location can turn having to ask for help into a chore. Being able to instantly connect with a librarian via chat can be helpful in both of these scenarios. Chat gives students more anonymity, allowing them to ask their questions without fear of the librarian later recognizing and judging them. Chat also allows for students to get quick answers from wherever they happen to be. The ability to chat with a librarian opens students up to librarians on the student’s time and at the student’s discretion. Personally, I just use chats to either express a problem to a company or to answer a small question very quickly. What I found from my first shadowing of a chat encounter was much more of an interaction than I had been expecting.
    <br>
    <br>The LibChat window is always open at the Reference Desk. When a new inquiry comes in, the computer emits a ping sound and the top tab flashes to get the librarian’s attention. The first chat that I witnessed came from a student, whom I have renamed Rose here, asking if she could print in color at the library. The Reference Desk librarian immediately noticed when the new chat popped up and replied that unfortunately there is not color printing anywhere on campus. This is apparently a pretty common request, so I was shown by the librarian to direct students to a printing store near campus. He offered Rose the information on the business, including their website, price, and location. At first, we both believed that this would probably be the end of the interaction. The chat is left open, as the librarian I shadowed explained that chats are not closed on the library’s side until the student has closed it on their side. 
    <br>
    <br>Here is where the interaction took the turn that I found compelling. Rose continued the interaction, asking if the place was currently open and where it was, if it was far from the school. The librarian stated that the print shop was about a five minute walk from campus. Rose next explained that she was working on an assignment and only had a few pages. She asked if the print shop had a page minimum for printing or if they did single pages. The librarian wrote back that according to the website there was no minimum (the site had a per page price and no previous students had mentioned a minimum. He also provided Rose with a phone number in case she had any other questions. 
    <br>
    <br>At this point we were again assuming that the conversation was most likely finished. There was no response from Rose after this final bit of information and her chat box stayed open. My pure speculation would be that she left the library page open while she went and did her printing. About forty-five minutes later, the chat went inactive, with the chat box changing color from green to red indicating that Rose had signed off. 
    <br>
    <br>It would be expected for students to ask librarians questions about the library and its services. What I found to be so interesting was that rather than cutting off the conversation after getting the initial information, Rose continued to ask questions. Along with that, her questions were ones that had theoretically been answered in the first response, when the librarian shared the website with her. She trusted the librarian to have full knowledge of the establishment he was pointing her to, which was a fair expectation that proved to be true. Through his own past experience of the printing shop, as well as with utilizing the shop’s own website, the librarian was able to answer all of Rose’s questions. The ease of use for the chat system almost turned the librarian into a “Google” for Rose to ask her questions of. 
    <br>
    <br>The ability of the librarian to answer all of Rose’s questions, as well as the fact that Rose did not chat later with follow-up questions leads me to believe that this was a successful reference interaction. The asker was able to get the necessary information to her question and I do not have a way for this to have been improved upon in this specific case.

                        <br> Librarians are the societal keepers of knowledge; we help people find what they need to know. Unfortunately, sometimes people come to us expecting that our ability to find their answers means that we will automatically do all of their work for them. Such seemed to be the case for my second interaction reflection.
                        <br>
                        <br> At the Reference Desk, we were aware that a class had given an assignment for students to look into specific topics, as we had already had a couple groups come in asking for assistance. Our last group looking for help was four first year students. Their teacher had asked them to look into bullying, requiring them to come up with five resources from the library to use in their research. The group approached the desk and simply asked for the librarian to find them these resources. Their body language (standing a bit away from the desk, fidgeting as if they wanted to leave, talking amongst themselves) indicated they were hoping for a quick answer. 
                    <br>
                    <br>The librarian used this as a learning exercise. She asked them how familiar they were with the library’s site and resources. They all replied that they did not know much about how or where to find materials. The librarian showed them the library’s website and how to search the catalog. She quickly explained how keyword searches worked, offering different possible search terms they could look into. The librarian showed them a few of the possible books to be checked out, noting the call numbers and explaining that in the Library of Congress classification system, books of the same subject are usually grouped together.
                   <br>
                   <br> In order to help them find the best books, the librarian then asked what their specific research topic was. The students had not yet thought of a specific topic within bullying, and debated for a few minutes. During this time, you could see them starting to get more comfortable with spending time at the reference desk. One girl sat down at the chair by the desk, one took out a notebook, and the other two physically moved closer to hear. Because there was a lot of material on it, the group settled on cyber bullying. The librarian showed them the call numbers for books on this, which they wrote down. 
                    <br>
                    <br>With their list of required books completed, the librarian offered to help them find articles. The girls explained that according to the assignment, they just needed any five sources. The librarian challenged them to look at their topic a little deeper. Yes, they only needed to find five sources, but since they were here with help, why not take full advantage? It is hard to describe, but the way that she spoke with them was not pushy. She managed to offer her assistance without making the students feel like they had no choice in the matter. She came off as genuine in her desire to get the group the best resources for their assignment. 
                    <br>
                    <br>One girl, who appeared to be the group leader, suggested that her group just stay and look for articles with the librarian. Her reasoning echoed the librarian’s point, that her group might as well get as many sources they could. The girls huddled around the librarian’s computer as she walked them through the steps to searching the library’s databases. By the end of the interaction, the group had multiple book call numbers, knew that there would be similarly subjected books next to the books they were searching for, understood how to search databases, and had a list of keywords to plug into databases that would yield relevant results.
                    <br>
                    <br>As said previously, some students come to a librarian hoping that by doing so they have avoided the necessity of doing a lot of their own work. This has been noted as an issue with reference desks in my classes. I chose to write about this interaction because it seemed to highlight this problem, but ultimately resulted in the students engaging with the librarian. I was impressed at how the librarian handled the group of students wanting to be handed a list of perfect sources, teaching the group how the library website worked. Not only this, but the librarian was able to take their broad subject matter and help them narrow it to a more manageable research topic. What had started as a group of people haphazardly standing by a desk asking for answers morphed into a group of students actively searching with a librarian to find the best materials for their topic.
                    <br>
                    <br>From this I learned that students are open to the learning experience. My past worry had been that if a student expected, but was not given, quick and easy answers, he/she would become either bored or annoyed. This still may be true, but from the interactions that I have witnessed at the LIU Brooklyn Reference Desk, it appears that students do understand that by approaching a librarian they are engaging in a two-way interaction.
