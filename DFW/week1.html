    <h1>Week One: Introduction to the Library</h1>
</a>
<p>
    <br>As a little introduction: though I have worked in an academic library during my undergrad for three
    years, I have not had a lot of contact with the reference department. At my school, the circulation
    desk was near the entrance to the building, with reference being their own desk on the next floor
    up. Because I was just a student, I was instructed not to answer reference questions, only to
    direct students to the trained professionals upstairs. I was very excited to hear about this
    opportunity at the Long Island University Brooklyn because it would allow me to gain experience in
    a new setting. My MLIS classes have touched on reference work, walking us through the reference
    interview process and ingraining the importance of open and neutral questions into my mind. I was
    and am particularly looking forward to being able to shadow real reference librarians and have
    their insight and mentorship as I start interacting with students.
    <br>
    <br> Only students, faculty, staff, and those with official visitor badges are allowed onto the LIU
    Brooklyn campus. This means that the people one sees in the library are usually the people who will
    have access to all of the resources because they have identification cards. The library begins on
    the third floor of the Library Learning Center Building. The main entrance on the third floor holds
    the Reference Desk, computers and printing stations, a Quiet Room, and a lot of study areas. There
    are two staircases that lead to the fourth floor, which holds more study spaces, staff offices,
    Interlibrary Loan, Periodicals, the Archives, and a Language Learning/Tutoring center. Oddly
    enough, to get to the fifth floor, one must either leave the library on the third floor and take
    the elevators down the hall, or on the fourth floor one may go through the Language
    Learning/Tutoring Center to the elevators there. The fifth floor holds the actual books, the
    Circulation Department, the Media Center, the Instructional Center, study spaces, and
    Administrative offices.
    <br>
    <br>I mention the layout of the building because my first impression was a mix of confusion and
    amazement. Even with all of my classes in library school, I still associate an academic library
    with physical items. However, it seems that in the LIU Brooklyn library, it was almost hard to find
    the physical items. There is a big emphasis on space for students. I spoke with one librarian who
    offered the idea that because their campus is nonresidential, perhaps they have more of a need for
    areas for students to get together to hang out and do homework between classes. There are no rules
    about noise level, plenty of seating for groups and individuals, and though food is discouraged,
    snacks still find their way into the building. This means that the University’s library is a
    popular and bustling place. There is a constant low rumble of conversations and students can be
    seen streaming in and out of the building near constant.
    <br>
    <br>The “Ask a Librarian” Reference Desk sits right at the entrance on the third floor. One of the
    first things I noticed while sitting and observing is that because it is a new semester with new
    students and classes, the open library setting invites a lot of directional questions. People
    recognize the library as an information center and rely on the librarian’s within to be able to
    tell them where they need to go. Unfortunately, I felt as lost as those students when they asked! I
    was very grateful to have someone who was familiar with the campus to step in and assist.
    Thankfully it is only week one, and I will have plenty of time to become more knowledgeable about
    the campus and resources.
    <br>
    <br>Another product of the Reference Desk being at the entrance is that it gets asked a lot of
    basic library questions. We had several students inquiring about the printing location and process,
    looking for different classrooms in the Instructional Center, and in need of office supplies. Even
    though times are listed on the door, there were also questions about the library’s hours. People
    seemed happy to come over to the Reference Desk for advice, even when they could see signage with
    answers to their questions. I think this says a lot about the approachability people felt towards
    the librarians here; the students really did seem to believe that the librarians were there to help
    them, no matter the question. I found that this meant that the librarians needed to not only be
    experts in their fields, but also experts in the campus. They needed to know where to point
    students looking to get ID cards, to turn in health forms, those having trouble finding classrooms,
    as well as showing students how to use the library website and being available for questions via
    phone, email, or chat. There were a lot of hats being worn by those manning the reference desk.
    <br>
    <br>This quarter I have three learning outcomes: shadowing and assisting at the reference desk,
    observing and leading a library instruction class, and creating a LibGuide for the website. My
    first week was mostly shadowing the reference desk, as well spending a bit of time getting
    acquainted with the concept of LibGuides and seeing what areas may be lacking on the LIU Brooklyn
    Library website. I liked slowly entering into the semester with the shadowing and learning, because
    they allowed for me to get my bearings on the environment. For my second week, I will be looking
    more at observing different teaching techniques!
