    <h1>Week Four: LibGuides</h1>
</a>
<p>
    <br>Technology and web skills are crucial for academic librarians. Librarians are known for being
    able
    to search different areas for information; what many may not realize is that often librarians
    contribute to the websites they may be searching. LibGuides are a popular content management system
    for libraries to create web pages. In layman’s terms, LibGuides are web templates that libraries
    can add their own information to.
    <br>
    <br> In order to gain as many of the necessary technology skills to work in an academic library,
    part of
    my learning outcomes in my Directed Fieldwork is creating LibGuides for the LIU Brooklyn Library’s
    website. To prepare, I spent the first couple weeks looking through the LibGuides currently on the
    site. I noted which subjects and courses had pages, clicking through and seeing the formats. I also
    compared these guides to those featured on by Springshare, the company that owns LibGuides, on
    their own website.
    <br>
    <br>My advisor and I each came up with possible LibGuides that I could create during the quarter.
    After
    some discussion, we settled on one academic LibGuides for a course and one lifestyle LibGuide for
    all students and faculty. For my fourth week I focused on beginning to write, style, and format my
    academic guide. Armed with the class syllabus and access to other class guides, I prepared to
    complete a page for OT [Occupational Therapy] 306: Therapy Skills.
    <br>
    <br>LibGuides pages are fairly easy to create. Thankfully, there are also a lot of instructional
    videos
    on Youtube to show how to do nearly any task! Along with this, LIU Brooklyn Library has a specific
    style format for all of their pages, so I did not have to worry about creating color schemes. I
    just had to decide what pages were necessary, what should be on those pages, and then create or
    find the information to include.
    <br>
    <br>I ended up working a lot on the content and formatting. I was surprised at how my limited
    coding
    skills made my pages look so much nicer. I decided to not only create my own boxes, but copied and
    reformatted boxes from other LIU Brooklyn Library pages, inserted videos, and added images. In the
    end, I felt very confident that my pages were informative, varied, and relevant. My advisor gave me
    feedback at the midway point and as I was nearing the end of my page. Because of this feedback, I
    am entering into my fifth week with slight alterations still to make to my pages to bring them up
    to professional standard.
    <br>
    <br>Before this DFW, LibGuides was something I knew existed, but was not something I had a lot of
    knowledge about. Considering the amount of time I was allowed to learn, play with, and change my
    page, I am very glad that I was able to begin my LibGuide experience in a learning environment. I
    know that this is a highly valuable skill for employed librarians and will probably be a task I
    complete in future work.
