    <h1>Week Two: Reference Desk and Library Instruction</h1>
</a>
<p>
    <br>By the beginning of my second week, I was starting to feel much more comfortable with the tasks I
    was observing. I had picked up the answers to the more common questions asked of the desk (I had an
    idea of basic locations, could explain printing, and was able to point out the stapler). I also
    noticed that I was actively recognizing students who spent a lot of time in the library. My
    confidence in my environment definitely translated to confidence at my job. My first week I did
    answer student questions at the desk, but I would also try to direct them to the professional
    librarian if possible and explain that I may be incorrect. This week, I was tried to be more
    authoritative and answer the questions I knew the answers to in a manner that did not require other
    assistance. Of course, had I gotten a complicated question or one that stumped me, I definitely
    would have turned for help. But, I enjoyed being able to sit and be of some use answering student
    questions.
    <br>
    <br>Another new experience for me this week was starting my teaching observation. I shadowed six
    one-hour classes taught by three different librarians. I am sure I will go into more exact detail
    in my personal teaching reflection, but I still want to mention a bit about the classes here in my
    reflection.
    <br>
    <br>LIU Brooklyn’s First Year Seminar (FYS) library training is an approximately fifty minute class
    on how to use the library. Originally, it was a librarian projecting a screen to students and
    displaying how to find databases and citations. About five years ago, this was changed to a more
    interactive learning technique. Today, students participate in a game called “The Amazing Library
    Race.” Like the TV show, students are put into small groups and given clues. They must complete
    each set of clues before moving on to the next ones. Whichever team completes all four legs of the
    race first is awarded a prize.
    <br>
    <br>I really enjoyed watching this all play out. During my study abroad course this past summer we
    had two librarians from Oregon come to speak to us about their library instruction. Similarly, they
    use games to reinforce library facts as they say interaction promotes better understanding. I think
    this is shown through “The Amazing Library Race.” Many of the students came in quite lost, unsure
    of how to get to the classroom. Within the class period, though, they learned the locations of
    several key area (circulation, media center, computer labs, etc) and what resources the library has
    to offer.
    <br>
    <br>My final reflection of this week comes from one of my previous worries. Going into this
    directed fieldwork, I had been a little nervous about being the “knowledge center” of the library.
    To me, reference librarians are magic. They can find you anything you need to know! That is a very
    tall order to fill. And indeed, I found the reference librarians I came into contact with were
    every bit as intelligent and skilled as I had anticipated. But what I also noticed is that to be a
    reference librarian, you don’t actually need to know everything.
    <br>
    <br>There are some things librarians are expected to know, but when students come with very
    specific questions, they did not seem angry or put out that the librarian had to do a bit of
    research with them to find the answers. One interaction I saw was a student asking about how to
    determine if her sources were reputable. She explained her subject and went through the sources
    with the librarian. The student was not surprised that the librarian first had to google the
    subject to get her bearings on what research would be appropriate for the topic. Instead, it
    allowed the librarian and the student to discuss the subject together and come up with ideas.
    <br>
    <br>I had felt this pressure that I needed to know everything right away to be the most helpful.
    However, after shadowing this week I was relieved to find that instead of needing to be an expert
    in every field, I just have to be open and ready to look into any topic.
