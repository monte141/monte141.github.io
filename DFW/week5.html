    <h1>Week Five: Class Observation</h1>
</a>
<p>
    <br>As midterms approach at LIU Brooklyn, more and more classes have been scheduling instructional
    classes at the library. This week, in addition to sitting at the Reference Desk and working on my
    LibGuides, I observed four classes: two were English 16 classes (basic composition) with different
    instructors, one was a Core Seminar class (another basic writing class, focused more on evaluating
    sources than the technicalities of writing), and one was for Law 211 (writing using law cases). I
    had previously sat in on an English 16 and a Core Seminar class, taught by different instructors
    than this week.
    <br>
    <br>Through all of my observation, I picked up that there are certain things that every instructor
    does, and certain little bits they do to make their classes unique. Every instructor began the
    class with a basic introduction to the library. No matter the majors or years, every class seemed
    like a mix of people who had been to the library before and those who had not. Instructors would
    explain the libraryâ€™s web site and the differences between books, ebooks, and articles. Each
    instructor also would show how to search both the catalog and the database list.
    <br>
    <br>Before each class the instructors had looked through the syllabus and the assignments the
    students were working on. They usually had already done some preliminary searches, figuring out the
    best keywords and databases to use. This is not to say that they did not improvise or change things
    in class, just that they came prepared with searches they knew would be good examples. They would
    also have prepared an activity for the class to work on. Typically they tried to tie this to the
    class assignment. For example, in one of the English 16 classes the students were given a sheet to
    help evaluate articles they found. They were instructed to find at least one relevant article to
    their topic and email it to themselves and their teacher. Hopefully, having this source would help
    them as they started writing their paper.
    <br>
    <br>There are many small variances between teaching styles. Each instructor has created his/her own
    activities for the group, so these may differ slightly. When one instructor for English 16 found
    that none of the students had experience with call numbers, she took the whole class into the
    circulation area to demonstrate how to find a book in the stacks. Overall, though there may be
    differences, by the end of each class it seemed like students not only had a better grasp on the
    library and its resources, but also had a good idea of where to start their research.
    <br>
    <br>My goal is to start to take a more active role in these instructional classes. Now that the
    First Year Seminar classes are winding down, the classes will be more focused on actual research
    methods and techniques. With additional observation in the coming weeks, my Directed Fieldwork
    Supervisor and I hope that I can start to step in to co-teach some of the more common instructional
    classes.
