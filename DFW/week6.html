    <h1>Week Six: Mid-Quarter</h1>
</a>
<p>
    <br>This week marks being halfway through the quarter. That means my supervisor and I took time this
    week to sit and complete the Mid-Quarter Report and reflect on how things have gone so far.

    <br>
    <br>In just six weeks, I have accomplished a lot of my Learning Outcomes. First, I have observed
    interactions at the Reference Desk. This was very informative as I have not previously worked in
    reference. I have become comfortable and competent enough that I have been able to staff the desk
    alone a few times, answering student questions and assisting in research. Second, I have shadowed
    many different library instruction classes, from First Year Seminar to Journalism to Law classes.
    Here, I have been able to begin teaching a First Year Seminar on my own. This has been great, not
    only because it is a fun experience, but also because I have been able to step in and assist when
    needed. Third, and last, I have successfully created multiple LibGuides for the LIU Brooklyn
    Library page. Before this, I knew what LibGuides were, but I had not had any experience with
    working on them personally. There was a bit of a learning curve, but with time and feedback, I now
    have two professional-level guides for students. Looking at all of these accomplishments, I am
    proud of how much I have done in just half of my Directed Field Work time.

    <br>
    <br>It is midterm for the Long Island University Brooklyn students, too. I see this at the Reference
    Desk with the sheer number of students in and out of the library building. As the semester
    progresses, more and more students are spending time working and studying in the library. During
    the first few weeks there were indeed students in the library, but many of them could be found
    sitting in groups and socializing. Now, one still has groups who are just hanging out, but more
    often than that, one will see students sitting alone or in small groups, heads bent over notebooks
    and computers. There is a steady stream of students entering and leaving, even earlier in the
    morning.

    <br>
    <br>With the increase in students, there has been an increase in research questions. At the beginning
    of the quarter, I saw a lot of students coming to the Ask-A-Librarian desk for directions and more
    basic questions (such as, how/where do I print?). Increasingly, students coming up to the desk will
    have an assignment in hand and ask more detailed questions. This has been very helpful, as I can
    watch the librarian-on-dutyâ€™s search techniques and review research tips.

    <br>
    <br>As new students are getting more comfortable in the campus, First Year Seminar classes are winding
    down. Instead, I am seeing more advanced classes coming in for library sessions. These classes are
    focused on preparing for their final assignments. Though there is a library resources overview, a
    lot of these classes are centered around how to find the best results for their particular field.
    For example, in a Law class I observed, the instructor showed some of the Law databases, as well as
    how to best craft keywords to get relevant results.

    <br>
    <br>Of course, a reflection of the past half of the quarter would not be complete without a note of
    what I hope for the next half. In the coming five weeks, there is still a lot I am hoping to do.
    Per my Learning Outcomes, I will complete my interaction reflections and teaching reflection. As I
    continue to sit at the Reference Desk, I hope to interact with more students. I am also hoping that
    with final assignments coming up, I will be able to provide more research-specific assistance. I am
    currently waiting on final approval before my LibGuides will be published to the LIU Brooklyn
    Library site. Next, I will be turning my attention to updating and reformatting some of the popular
    handouts for the classes. Finally, with less First Year Seminar classes to teach, I am planning on
    starting to co-teach some of the English 16 classes. These are basic composition classes, with the
    instructor showing students the library resources and basic search techniques. Depending on how
    many classes I shadow, I may or may not begin co-teaching other classes as well.

    <br>
    <br>Thus far, I have learned an incredible amount from this DFW. I would highly recommend the
    experience and this location to others wanting to learn more about academic library work.
