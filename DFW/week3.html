    <h1>Week Three: Library Instruction</h1>
</a>
<p> <br>Library Instruction was a task I was quite nervous to delve into. My previous library
    instruction experience has only been as a student, going through basic library functions in my
    Freshman Seminar and Composition classes during my undergrad. Added to this was the previously
    mentioned talk by library instructors I was present for during my study abroad course this past
    Early Fall. When Library Instruction was offered as a possible learning outcome by my DFW
    supervisor, I was unsure of what exactly this would entail, but more than willing to give it a go.
    <br>
    <br>For the past two weeks, most of my instructional observation has been on the First Year Seminar
    (FYS) Library Introduction, a relay race entitled “The Amazing Library Race.” I observed four
    different instructors leading multiple classes of new freshman through a race about the library and
    its materials. At the end of my second week, I was able to step in and co-lead a class with a
    librarian. I assisted in giving instructions and passing out clues as teams returned. This was the
    perfect introduction for me, as it allowed me to test my instructional knowledge with a back-up for
    anything I forgot. I was a bit nervous, so some of the details did slip my mind, and the librarian
    was there to make sure the students got all of the information. While I was running the race, it
    was also clear to the students that the librarian was my supervisor, and they would bring their
    answers to her before showing them to me. Overall, having the opportunity to co-lead allowed me to
    test my skills while also having a safety net when necessary.
    <br>
    <br>By this week, I was very comfortable in the structure of the FYS classes. I lead my first solo
    Amazing Library Race session on Wednesday, following it up with another session on Thursday. Both
    went well, and when reflecting on them I do not think there was any information I had forgotten to
    give to the students. Although it was nice to co-lead, teaching a class on my own was good because
    I was forced into a true leadership role. I was fully in charge, from set up to take down. Finally,
    teaching races helped me to feel like a part of the reference team. I was able to help out, picking
    up a class that needed a new instructor. It is always a good feeling when you know you are helping.
    <br>
    <br>I do not have a public speaking phobia, but many times having to speak in front of groups makes
    me nervous. I was surprised to find that with the library instruction, once I got into the groove,
    this anxiety just melted away. I had sit through enough classes to know what to say, how to give
    hints, and what to expect from the students. When looking back at my week, I noted that I was
    genuinely happy with the teaching experience. In fact, it is now something that I would think about
    pursuing in my future career. I don’t know if I would want to be a full-time library instructor,
    but my limited classroom time at LIU Brooklyn has showed me that it would be an element to a future
    job that I would enjoy.
    <br>
    <br>There are still other classes that I am going to observe. I have watched an English 16 (basic
    composition) class, which involved actual database searching and instruction, rather than a library
    overview. This in-depth look on how and what to search is more akin to my previous library
    instruction experience. I am hoping to get to sit in on other, more advanced classes as well.
    Perhaps if I learn enough from observation, I can begin to co-lead or even fully teach one of these
    other sessions!
